      <b>Accuracy, ability to predict possible troubles and real time warning</b>: these are the keywords relating to the present manufacturing intelligence. In other words, a cutting edge tool that measures the key performance indicators should be able to identify precisely and quickly all patterns that characterize manufacturing output and show, if necessary, what goes wrong.&nbsp;
      <div>
       &nbsp; 
       <br>When we talk about this type of analysis, until now we mainly think about
       <b> a quantitative investigation </b>which measures how things work in a production line, from energy consumptions to the productiveness of human resources. All these pieces of information – that represent, as usual in our field, a big amount of data to manage – give us a quite precise but static picture of a plant under the accounting and productive profile. But, more and more, it is not enough.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       &nbsp; 
       <br>Almost every industry has to handle data that comes from different sources and after understanding how productive process works, the aim is to know hic et nunc which factors and 
       <b>interactions</b> among them affect production and how to face them effectively to improve the overall performance. So the management needs to:&nbsp; not worry about the fact that data comes from various sources, from suppliers, that have their own systems, to different inner divisions; be aware that quantitative information is only a part of what it is important to know, whereas understanding relationships among all elements involved in production is the key point to take a step forward.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       &nbsp; 
       <br>In this sense our approach has the edge over because Tykli's technology enables the understanding of 
       <b>cause and effect relationships</b>, even if their roots aren't immediately visible and easily correlated with each other. Indeed, the distinctive feature of our tool is 
       <b>predicting</b> possible future events according to the results from the analisys of the production's data. So all top level managers can dispose of an on demand overview that shows strong and weak points of the productive processes. Moreover, this analysis boosts the managers' ability to optimize their choices about business strategies by depicting future scenarios that could concern production.&nbsp; At the same time, our software works also at task force level as a real time alert which enables to cope immediately with any event that could occur along the assembly line.&nbsp;

      <p>&nbsp;The future of news could be called <b>micromedia</b>: contrary to the present overload of information, we will receive a flow of news strongly shaped according to our geographical location, job, relationship status, interests, contacts and even our mood at a certain moment.</p> 
      <p> It might sound a bit like science fiction, but actually some digital media outlets such as <i>BuzzFeed</i> or social networks are already using algorithms that produce in this way a data driven flow of information (not only news strictly speaking) based on our preferences.</p> 
      <p> Technologies able to support the birth of this new generation of news provider already exist and a key role is played by <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/" target="blank">semantic web</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data" target="blank">linked data</a>. </p> 
      <p> But a question rises considering this perspective: will it be <b>tech or media companies </b>to produce and deliver this flow?</p> 
      <p> Quoting Jeff Jervis, who has written extensively on journalism as a service, <a href="http://www1.newseum.org/about/overview/officers/paul-sparrow-bio-page.html" target="blank">Paul Sparrow</a>, senior vice president at the Newseum, <a href="http://ajr.org/2014/10/28/radically-different-future-news/" target="blank">says</a>:</p> 
      <p><br> </p> 
      <p style="text-align: center;"><i>While technology companies have made huge strides in their effort to deliver targeted, customized ads meeting the interests of specific individuals, news/media companies must stop thinking of themselves as just content providers and fundamentally change their focus to become platforms providing critical </i><i><b>services</b></i><i>, as well as information.</i></p> 
      <p>To do it, Sparrow adds<br></p> 
      <p style="text-align: center;"><i>[...]media companies must engage <br>in the same kind of information collection and data mining <br>that retailers and technology companies have been doing for years.</i></p> 
      <p>This change in perspective by the newsroom isn't predictable, but there are already some ongoing experiments to do so. For instance, inside the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/posts/BBC-News-Lab" target="blank">BBC News Labs</a>, they are carrying out <b>The News Juicer</b>, a platform that makes it possible to associate all useful contents connected to a concept inside the broadcaster's archive thanks to linked data. Through a query, the user can link, compare and combine news and facts related to a specific topic, i.e. those about the city of Cambridge in UK but not Cambridge in Massachussets. </p> 
      <p> So, the UK European election in 2014 were reported with a <b>100 percent-linked-data coverage</b> as well as the BBC is ready to do the same with General Election next year. Even new apps which will be released around Christmas will give users the chance to create thematic pages according to his own preferences.</p> 
      <p> These are probably only the first steps along the way that could bring us to the “micromedia age”. It remains to be seen who will win the challenge for realizing the most reliable but also engaging version of this service between tech and media companies. The latter, for sure, now have to close the gap. &nbsp;</p>

      <b>digital humanities</b>. 
      <br> Digital humanities, as 
      <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S41/14/10S31/index.xml?section=topstories" target="blank">explained</a> by Meredith Martin, associate professor of English at Princeton University, “
      <i>brings computational tools such as large-scale databases and text-analysis software to bear on traditional humanities scholarship.</i>"&nbsp;
      <div>
       &nbsp; 
       <br>Martin is the director of the new 
       <a href="https://digitalhumanities.princeton.edu/" target="blank">Center for digital humanities in Princeton</a>, officially opened at the end of September, which aims to be a 
       <b>bridge</b> among humanities, computer sciences and library sciences. Supporting faculty, graduate and undergraduate researches, it is a good example of the huge number of topics that can be included under the label &nbsp;“digital humanities”.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       &nbsp; 
       <br>For instance, one project is the 
       <a href="https://digitalhumanities.princeton.edu/ppa/" target="blank">Princeton Prosody Archive</a>, a full-text searchable database created in 2007 which collects more than 10,000 records, such as manuscripts, manuals, articles and grammar books, about 
       <b>prosody</b> - the study of the metrical structure of verse - written between 1750 and 1923. But the Center also works on the “
       <b>virtual archeologist</b>” project, a software that helps to reconstruct frescoes of Akroti, on the Greek Island of Santorini, that were buried under volcanic ash 3500 years ago, simulating the traditional procedures followed at excavation sites.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       A forthcoming research will be about a complex dictionary of 
       <b>pre-modern Chinese texts</b>, made of a database of characters and sounds plus a hypertext version of all these texts. This project has been promoted by the Department of East Asian Studies and it will allow scholars to see and explore all existing intertextual relations.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       &nbsp; 
       <br>"
       <i>Because of the ability of computers to digest and store vast amounts of data” Martin adds, “things that would have taken scholars an entire career to research, computers can now do in a month. Instead of digging through archives trying to find the answer, in collaboration with a computer scientist, the humanist can come up with ways of using existing or new tools to generate a lot of answers very quickly. This, in turn, helps humanists pose new questions.</i>" &nbsp;&nbsp;

       &nbsp;“You can't manage what you don't measure”: this statement by Douglas Laney, an analyst at technology research and consulting firm 
       <a href="http://www.gartner.com/" target="_blank">Gartner</a> expresses a more and more frequent issue for companies that run big businesses collecting and selling data but don't know exactly 
       <b>how to estimate</b> these intangible assets.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       &nbsp; 
       <br>As 
       <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/whats-all-that-data-worth-1413157156" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> reports&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       &nbsp; 
       <br>
       <div style="text-align: center;">
        <i>Corporate holdings of data and other “intangible assets,” such as patents, trademarks and copyrights, could be worth more than $8 trillion, according to Leonard Nakamura, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. That’s roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product of Germany, France and Italy combined.&nbsp;</i>
       </div>
       <div>
        <br>
       </div> But, as opposed to machinery or cash, there aren't 
       <b>common rules</b> yet to record them.&nbsp; The topic concerns not only tech companies like Google, Facebook or Apple, but for instance supermarket chains which collect data about customers' habits and sell it to multinationals interested in tailoring their own products and marketing.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       &nbsp; 
       <br>Until now the Financial Accounting Standards Board, an US organization which establishes and improves accounting principles, has failed its attempts to find shared criteria useful to define how big data is worth.&nbsp; Although some experts claim that investors don’t need to know the specific value of intangible assets, but that it is more important to understand other factors like how companies use data to make money, it seems that accountants find hard to walk at the same rate of new forms of properties. &nbsp;

      <br> Whoever seeks will find, says an old proverb. But it doesn't consider the time you need to do it and mainly how much the outcomes really fit your preferences. Nowadays we live in a digital environment where we leave daily evidence of our presence and preferences, commenting on social networks, “googling” information or checking-in into a specific place. This is not noise: on the contrary, it represents 
      <b>an extremely rich context</b> where tools like recommendation systems still have room to improve accuracy and appeal of their issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <div>
       &nbsp; 
       <br>In this sense, 
       <i>Tykli Forward</i> can provide a powerful tool for profiling users and personalizing suggestions for them, adding this enormous number of external inputs to information that traditionally helps understand users' behaviour and 
       <b>exploring and ranking relationships</b> that lie among them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       &nbsp; 
       <br>Recommendation systems work, for instance, behind user interfaces of on demand tv channels, music web players, news sites and e-commerces, and no matter what the user looks for, this kind of activity falls into what we define as&nbsp;
       <b>complex systems</b>, as we have:&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       - many subjects who act as interconnected parts, i.e. thousands of surfers who, through their computers, search, listen and recommend to other users the latest rock songs, even outside the borders of the specific website where they do that;
      </div>
      <div>
       - a continuous flow of information moves from users to content providers and back, but also among users and even, as told before, in less predictable directions thanks to the digital interactions we do everyday in a number of different channels;&nbsp;
       <br>
       <div>
        <font><font>- a big amount of data to deal with that is generated in this way. <br><br> </font></font>
       </div>
       <div>
        <font><font>Until now, recommendation systems process different sorts of information about consumers: who and how many they are, which kind of subscription they have chosen, which types of items they prefer, when they make use of them during the day, how much time they spend examining each one. The same goes for products: price, features, internal rating. But now they are not enough: relationships among these elements and all those that come from the <b>surrounding contexts</b> are fundamental. <br><br> </font></font>
       </div>
       <div>
        <font><font><i>Tykli Forward</i>, beyond collecting this sort of information, connect them, considering what happens in all environments where users act. So, not only the fact that one client buys a movie, sees it once at evening time, but also that two days later he comments on Twitter about the main actor who is making a new film in his own city and then several people join the discussion, commenting and suggesting another movie. Giving a different value for each of these connections, it enhances the skill to<b>&nbsp;better</b>&nbsp;<b>predict </b>what users like; at the same time, it works in a flexible way because the relevance of every relationship discovered varies according to the starting point of researches.&nbsp;</font></font>

      <!--<p>New beta of <a href="http://sparql.tyk.li">*Ql</a>, our web based SPARQL endpoint query editor.&nbsp;</p>--> We have updated our SPARQL editor,&nbsp;
      <a href="http://sparql.tyk.li/">*Ql</a>,&nbsp;with a totally renovated user interface.
      <div>
       The main changes are:
      </div>
      <div>
       <br>
      </div>
      <div>
       <b>Prefixes Editor</b>
      </div>
      <div>
       First. you have a more clear and usable way to select and add namespace&nbsp;prefixes. The namespace prefixes are now listed in a collapsable text area,&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       you can define them once and then hide the text area to save space on the screen. The checkbox fields that were used to select the most common prefixes have been converted to a select field that shows bot namespace uri and prefix, making it clearer which namespace are you actually using.
      </div>
      <div>
       <br>
      </div>
      <div>
       <b>Query Editor</b>
      </div>
      <div>
       We have found out that one query editor was not enough. while you are building a complex query, or exploring a new endpoint, it happens a lot that you write smaller query to inspect entities or properties. With the old interface, you could write more than one query and then select the query you wanted to use and run just the selected text.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       We found out that this approach required a lot of mouse and keyboard work, and we opted out to have more than one editor to work with. Every editor is collapsable and all of them inherit the prefixes&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       <br>
      </div>
      <div>
       <b>Common Operator</b>
      </div>
      <div>
       The run button is now on the header of each query, making it easy to understand which query you are about to run. Beside the 
       <i>run </i>button we have added some common operator like limit, order by and group by.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
       <br>
      </div>
      <div>
       <b>Format Query</b>
      </div>
      <div>
       When working on a query, the situation can start to be messy. We know that, and so we added a 
       <i>format </i>query button that will try to format and indent your query.
      </div>
      <div>
       <br>
      </div>
      <div>
       <b>Show Full Query</b>
      </div>
      <div>
       We added a button to open a modal where your query will be printed in full version, with prefixes, query body and operators.
      </div>
      <div>
       <br>
      </div>
      <div>
       *Ql is available
