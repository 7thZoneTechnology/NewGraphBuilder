        <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/psychology-of-price.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-681 aligncenter" alt="psychology-of-price" src="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/psychology-of-price.png" width="650" height="300"></a></p> 
        <p>“It’s like when a 39-year-old turns 40, the birthday feels like a big deal,” says <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7522426.stm" target="_blank">Robert Schindler</a>, a professor of marketing at UCLA. He’s talking about the effect of prices that end .99, how just a single penny between two larger amounts creates this symbolic buffer in our minds. So we perceive £3.99 as being <a href="http://marketing-bulletin.massey.ac.nz/V8/MB_V8_N1_Holdershaw.pdf" target="_blank">closer to £3</a> than £4, just as the 39-year-old man still believes he’s in his mid-30s: it’s both completely irrational and perfectly understandable. Welcome to the world of psychological pricing.</p> 
        <p>Shoppers have to process a lot of prices, especially online, to the point where it becomes overwhelming. Our memories <a href="http://marketing-bulletin.massey.ac.nz/V8/MB_V8_N1_Holdershaw.pdf" target="_blank">only process the first couple of digits</a> of a figure at a time so pounds inevitably take precedence over the trifles of pence. The effect is powerful. When a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1826172/psychology-behind-sweet-spots-pricing" target="_blank">Chicago grocery store</a> dropped the price of margarine from 89 cents to 71 cents it saw sales rise by a modest 65%. But then it lowered the price again, by just two cents, to 69 cents. The result was a sales jump of 222%. Subtracting that single penny or dollar to reveal a pair of nines is a magic trick for retailers, but it can come at a larger price.</p> 
        <p>What the industry calls ‘just-below’ prices are linked in our minds with special offers and promotions. According to marketing professor Robert Schindler, the format was<a href="http://blogs.ft.com/undercover/2008/08/why-do-prices-end-with-99p/#axzz3JQhTWXO7" target="_blank"> introduced in the 1870s</a> as a way for retailers to distinguish discounted products from their full price stock. But at some point the just-below prices simply became the norm, sale or no sale. And so, in 1894, James Eaton &amp; Co could assure the public that its $9.99 check suits were ‘Always the Cheapest’ in <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/02/01/how_99_cents_became_a_retailing_standby.html" target="_blank">newspaper adverts</a> that did away with whole number prices altogether. Today, however, certain stores still retain the approach’s original meaning.</p> 
        <p>Take Nordstrom, by Wikipedia’s admission an upscale fashion retailer. They price their clothes in <a href="http://blog.vendhq.com/post/64901824806/secret-effective-pricing-3-vital-questions-every-retailer-must-ask-setting-prices" target="_blank">whole numbers</a>: a pair of swimming trunks can be yours for precisely $152 and a bow tie will set you back exactly $55. There are cheaper places to buy your swimwear but even Nordstrom have clearance sales. Then you’ll see all sorts of prices: a wool fit suit is now $465.65 and a pair of toe cap boots are down to $126.96. The discounted prices are left with ragged edges. So why use whole numbers in the first place?</p> 
        <p><a href="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/psychology-of-price-quality.png"><img class=" wp-image-680 alignleft" alt="psychology-of-price-quality" src="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/psychology-of-price-quality.png" width="240" height="240"></a>Let’s take <a href="http://pragmaticpricing.com/2010/06/27/round-prices/" target="_blank">another study</a>: a pair of identical shoes were shown to customers at two different prices, $75.00 and $79.95. When asked to pick the higher quality shoes, most people pointed to the $75 pair. That’s because whole prices <a href="http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=7253" target="_blank">imply good quality</a>, so if Nordstrom reduces a pair of plimsolls to $134.98, and clearly shows they were previously $225, our perception of the shoes’ quality is unaffected by the new price.</p> 
        <p>Whole numbers are also simpler, more human. We use them when we’re asked to ‘name our price’ and most of us will round up a restaurant tip (only the miserly would fiddle around to leave 99p). There’s a reassuring solidity and <a href="http://coglode.com/gems/round-pricing-preference" target="_blank">trustworthiness</a> to them. Perhaps that’s why the supermarket ASDA recently <a href="http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/927510/brands-ditch-99p-round-pound-pricing-beat-discounters" target="_blank">ditched the decimal point</a> from many of its price tags, to simplify them, to show customers were getting an honest deal.</p> 
        <p>But there’s only so far a penny will get you. You won’t convince anyone that a $9.99 pair of shoes will last a lifetime just by adding another cent to the price.&nbsp;A cheap product just looks cheap.</p> 
        <p>It’s the same with chocolate. A stall at the 2006 Brussels Food Fare <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1/165f8838-839c-11da-9017-0000779e2340.html#axzz3IrVAcKDX" target="_blank">sold Belgian chocolates</a>. On the first day it charged €9 a box and sales were pretty good, so on the second day it decided to up the price to €15. Oddly, sales doubled. But then on the third day the price of a box fell to just €2. Hardly anyone wanted to buy a €2 box of Belgian chocolates.</p> 
        <p>As an experiment the chocolate stall was a success, demonstrating how much meaning we ascribe to the price of something. In this case, a box of €2 Belgian chocolates was read to mean a box of cheap chocolates, and no one visits a food fare to buy that. Researchers at <a href="http://www.wired.com/2011/04/should-we-buy-expensive-wine/" target="_blank">Caltech</a> took this further by presenting participants with two identical bottles of wine, saying one cost $10, the other $90. Most people said they preferred the latter.</p> 
        <p><a href="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/psychology-of-price-ikea-1.png"><img class=" wp-image-682 alignright" alt="psychology-of-price-ikea (1)" src="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/psychology-of-price-ikea-1.png" width="240" height="240"></a>But a cheap price doesn’t always harm the perceived value of something. You just have to explain <em>why</em> the price is so low. IKEA has built an entire business model around this, turning it into a sort of philosophy. Even in the IKEA restaurant you’ll see it, where ‘Why should I clear my own table?’ signs spell out exactly why the meatballs are only £3.80, why the desserts start from 50p, and why drink refills are free (you have to clear away your own tray).</p> 
        <p>Pricing is largely abstract and arbitrary – it’s just numbers after all. The diamond cartel De Beers demonstrated this to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/304575/" target="_blank">dramatic effect</a>. It was able to take a product with little intrinsic value and artificially arrive at the price of ‘two months’ salary’ – in part because of the stone’s rarity, but largely because they wanted to sell diamonds as something eternal, romantic and expensive. A $3 diamond just doesn’t say “lasting marriage”.</p> 
        <p>We like to think of pricing as being precise and objective, of being about the purity of numbers. But it’s people who browse, compare and buy, not computers, and the way we see a price tag is largely irrational, influenced by unconscious prejudices, assumptions and anchored by context. It’s by understanding this irrationality and creating sense from it that retailers are able to arrive at a fair price that also communicates a product’s value symbolically.</p>

       <div class="entry-content">
        <p dir="ltr"><a href="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/unnamed.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-643" alt="Christmas Segments from VisualDNA" src="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/unnamed.jpg" width="575" height="242"></a>Many brands and retailers face Christmas with both excitement and fear. Excitement for the possibilities of peak, and fear that seasonal discounting may hurt the bottom line.</p> 
        <p>In the run-up to Christmas, brands and retailers traditionally spend on marketing and discounting via generic festive messages they hope will convert enough potential buyers to beat the competition. But budgets could be spent far more effectively if it were possible to understand customers and prospects – and the Christmas buying experience they’re after.</p> 
        <p>People engage with Christmas shopping very differently: some have it all wrapped up by December 1, while others are still rushing around like headless turkeys on Christmas Eve. There’s Bargain Hunters who scour the web for the best deals, Family Shoppers who browse and browse to find perfect gifts for their nearest and dearest. There’s The Early Birds who enjoy a clinical Christmas and The Bohemians: those who buy big for a shock and awe season.</p> 
        <p>Conventional data might reveal what online customers are doing, where and when but it glosses over the fact that every consumer – offline and online – is a living, breathing human being with a lifetime of experiences and a distinctive set of character traits which shape their behaviour. Personality plays a huge role in governing how people respond to products, brands, advertising, promotions, onsite design, selection, pricing and much more besides.</p> 
        <p>If brands and retailers’ ultimate aim is to reach prospects on an emotional level – for Christmas or at any other time – then personality is vital information for advertisers to segment customers based on who they are, how they’ll shop, and what message will best resonate.</p> 
        <p>New approaches are now emerging that can provide a much broader picture of each online consumer, including insight into their psychology. As a result, a growing number of brands and retailers are now taking their first steps into a new world of market segmentation based on what truly motivates people and on what drives their purchasing behaviour. Researchers in psychology have spent decades building rich models based on the “Big Five” personality factors – Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.</p> 
        <p>Determining accurate personality profiles for a statistically significant group of known web users, then comparing their web browsing and purchasing habits with those of unknown users, it is possible to accurately infer the personalities of the second group of people. In the normally anonymous online world, this provides unprecedented insight into the likely behaviour and motivations of web visitors.</p> 
        <p>By using real-time analytics on big data, brands and retailers can see the personalities of online customers and prospects, monitor how they respond to different marketing and advertising approaches, determine the best messaging and approach for each type of customer, and then reach out to new – previously unknown – prospects using intelligent search and retargeting.</p> 
        <p dir="ltr">Understanding visitor personalities means that brands and advertisers can provide content, messages and offers that are relevant, personalised and meet the emotional needs of customers and prospects. Emotion is a major factor in both impulse-buying decisions and long-term brand loyalty. Knowing how consumers feel – about a particular advertising campaign, a set of products or the service they receive – can help businesses ensure maximum competitive differentiation. Most personality types like being sold to, so long as the product or service is relevant to their needs and presented at the right time.</p> 
        <p>By gathering and using data about the personalities of otherwise unknown online consumers, brands and advertisers can move beyond marketing that appeals to utilitarian concerns around pricing and product selection, and instead appeal to people’s aspirations, self-image and dreams. Naturally, there is less competition and more margin in the second category.</p> 
        <p>This Christmas represents a huge opportunity not only for delighting existing customers and converting prospects, but also for gaining valuable insights into their year-round buying propensity. As this is the busiest few weeks of the year for most consumer businesses, it offers the prospect of capturing the equivalent of months of data revealing the correlations between purchasing behaviour and visitor personality.</p> 
        <p>When Christmas 2015 comes around, businesses that took the opportunity to determine the personalities of online consumers will have the information they need to create even more compelling customer journeys and experiences.</p>

        <p><strong>There are much better tools and theories to understand people today than there were in the years when focus groups, shopper panels and use and attitude studies were first devised. Big data allows us to capture observational truths as opposed to claims. And psychology has moved on from psychoanalysis and behaviourism, to decision theory and behavioural economics.&nbsp;</strong></p> 
        <p>This shouldn’t be news to anyone in the research industry.&nbsp; But it’s also true that despite what is discussed in the research journals and blogs, industry insiders definitively lag outsiders in the tech industry when it comes to putting new advances to work.&nbsp; Why is this?</p> 
        <p>Some, like Dr Benny Cheung, a director at Decision Technology, suggest many don’t understand the limitations of the old approaches and so don’t see the advantages of these emerging techniques.</p> 
        <p>“As psychologists we know that two key pillars of existing approaches to market research – asking consumers to extrapolate decision making outside of its natural context/environment, and asking them to tell us why they acted in a certain way – are both flawed. Humans simply are very poor at doing these things.”</p> 
        <p>People can’t explain their behaviour, but there are tests that can accurately measure an individual’s personality in terms of the ‘big five’ traits, which in turn can predict their future behaviour.</p> 
        <p><strong>Predicting behaviour</strong></p> 
        <p>The Big Five is decades old, but is not widely used in the conventional research industry.&nbsp; By combining this public domain model with proprietary testing methods and big data we’ve been able to create value.</p> 
        <p>In the credit industry, we can predict who will, and will not, pay back a loan accurately enough for banks to use in making lending decisions.&nbsp; For marketers it allows us to segment target audiences by demographics, interests, intentions and personality.</p> 
        <p>Those segments can be targeted via our global network reaching more than 300 million consumers. Using modelling techniques, our data scientists have transformed this data into more than 110 million deep profiles. In the UK alone we have 45 million profiles available through 15 major advertising technology platforms.</p> 
        <p>Initial results from a recent study with Cambridge University and a VisualDNA client showed that there were huge differences in the ROI obtained when targeting different personality types – some were four times more responsive than others. Further to this, tailoring the advertising so that it matched the personality type it was targeted at, led to a greater return on investment across all segments.</p> 
        <p>Several other London-based companies are also in this ‘psychtech’ space and are challenging the accepted leaders in market research. These include Decode Marketing, which uses ideas from behavioural economics combined with implicit testing, to get insight into consumers’ unconscious preferences for brands.</p> 
        <p>Recent start-up CrowdEmotion uses emotional machine learning in media to detect emotion in real time. It is seeing up to twice the accuracy in predicting audience appreciation over other metrics like demographics and self-report.</p> 
        <p>Decision Technology is a specialised consultancy applying both emerging and established techniques in the fields of experimental psychology and behavioural economics to provide businesses with much richer analytics to support decisions.</p> 
        <p><strong>Research industry playing it safe</strong></p> 
        <p>So why is ‘psychtech’ the preserve of geeks and entrepreneurs?&nbsp; One theory is that the research industry has turned inward and become too ‘safe’, trusting in what seems to work rather than challenging it.</p> 
        <p>Decode’s Phil Barden says: “The irony is that the biggest barrier to change is the brain itself. Humans have inbuilt cognitive biases that protect the status quo and reject new ideas that contradict existing paradigms or beliefs. One way to overcome this is ‘social proof’. When we see others doing something it reduces the perceived risk of us doing the same.”</p> 
        <p>CrowdEmotion’s CEO, Matthew Celuszak, also feels a change of mindset is required: “For many – especially in Britain – emotion is still a dirty word. We are conditioned to control our emotions as a sign of maturity and respect. So talking about emotions – let alone studying them as the basis of decisions – makes people feel uncomfortable.”</p> 
        <p>Whatever the reasons why adoption has been slow, the early results indicate that it won’t be for long.</p> 
        <p>Outsiders could be agents of widespread change. Our role is to educate, demonstrate and validate all the time, creating the social proof that gives brands and agencies the confidence to invest in these new psychtech models. While established players may be slow to invest in prototypes and NPD, we would be surprised if more aren’t joining us in using these methods soon.</p>

        <p><em>By&nbsp;Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic,&nbsp;PhD.&nbsp;</em></p> 
        <p><a href="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DataBlog-the-truth-about-cheating.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-564" alt="Cheating a personality test" src="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DataBlog-the-truth-about-cheating.png" width="650" height="300"></a></p> 
        <p>Are you cynical about personality tests? Do you worry that they may be a waste of time because the people filling them in are likely to fake their answers? Do you think that you might be able to skew the test results yourself? Does that make you think the results of all tests are therefore likely to be bogus?</p> 
        <p>Well, don’t worry. The chances are that if you’re given a well designed survey, all of those questions will have been factored in and effectively countered.</p> 
        <p><a href="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DataBlog-the-truth-about-cheating-3.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-572" alt="personality test" src="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DataBlog-the-truth-about-cheating-3.png" width="241" height="241"></a>Personality tests have been used for clinical, educational, and employment assessment for more than 100 years – information I provide not only to show that they have a proven track record, but also because during that time the tests themselves have been submitted to rigorous assessment. These studies have produced <strong>three key findings and strategies for taking the faking out of the equation</strong>:</p> 
        <ol> 
         <li>Most people try to skew their results to the same degree. So, for instance, in high stakes tests such as those relating to job interviews, people tend to inflate the points they assume to be positive by around 10-20%. But because most people bend things in the same direction, it’s easy to see where meaningful differences remain.</li> 
         <li>The best tests conceal their true intentions: people taking them don’t know what is really being assessed, or why certain questions are being asked. What’s more, plenty of tests can also assess how long people take to answer each question and alert assessors to any unusual response patterns or internal inconsistencies. The net result is that it’s generally better to answer honestly than try to game the system.</li> 
         <li>There are a few people who are good at distorting their personal results in spite of the two above points. But that doesn’t really matter because 1) that level of ability is extremely rare (there tend to be 80 or 90 people who can’t for every person that can successfully game the system) and 2) there’s a direct correlation between an ability to game tests and success in the kinds of outcomes these tests are designed to predict. If you’re that good at answering personality test questions, you also tend to do well in careers, relationships and health. It is a skill that predicts high levels of adaptation and social functioning in the real world.</li> 
        </ol> 
        <h2>Do personality tests reveal the real you?</h2> 
        <p><a href="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DataBlog-the-truth-about-cheating-5.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-592" alt="DataBlog-the-truth-about-cheating-5" src="http://datablog.visualdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DataBlog-the-truth-about-cheating-5.png" width="216" height="216"></a>You’re also probably looking at the tests the wrong way if you’re worried about them getting a mistaken version of the “real you” – or the real anyone for that matter. The tests aren’t designed to reflect how things are, they are designed to predict future behaviour. If your test results suggest you are impulsive that is really an assessment of how you may act in the future – which is to say that you are likely to make spontaneous, irrational, and careless decisions.</p> 
        <p>And because tests are there to predict, their effectiveness can be easily checked. A good example comes from tests within the financial services sector. If your test scores indicate that you are a risk taker, this inference can be tested against data gathered from your real future behaviour. Here, the success of the test doesn’t depend on whether the answers captured the “real you” but whether it predicted how you might act further down the line. “Honest” in the context of personality tests is simply defined as the relationship between your answers and your future behaviours.</p> 
        <p>This method of assessment even works with something as apparently subjective as whether test subjects have a good sense of humour. In tests, 90% say YES. They are not technically lying – they actually think they are funny. But the more objective truth is that only 10% of people are generally judged by others to possess the gift of comedy. Curiously, they typically answer NO when asked if they are amusing. Good tests can factor all that in and still predict whether someone will be funny, regardless of whether they answer the questions honestly, or whether they may be slightly deluded.</p>

       <div class="entry-content">
        <p>This article was first seen on – <a title="What makes a disruptive technology " href="http://betanews.com/2014/08/12/what-makes-a-disruptive-technology/" target="_blank">http://betanews.com/2014/08/12/what-makes-a-disruptive-technology/&nbsp;</a></p> 
        <h1><img style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.5em" alt="black swan" src="http://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/black-swan.jpg" width="640" height="426"></h1> 
        <div> 
         <p>According to Clayton M Christensen, author of The Innovator’s Dilemma, disruptive innovations are characterized by their ability to create entirely new markets rather than merely update existing markets with new products. They are black swans, rare events where new thinking and changing markets combine to create radical change.</p> 
         <p>A common example is the light bulb and Pearl Street Station — a major gamble by Thomas Edison. Within years of its development the kerosene lighting industry was all but non-existent, and the world was a brighter place. (The kerosene industry had similarly put an end to the whaling industry — thankfully — a few decades earlier).</p> 
         <div></div> 
         <p>Disruptive innovations also tend to involve making things simpler and cheaper than the alternatives, with unexpected results on multiple sectors. The motor car in the late 1800s was too expensive to be disruptive, but Henry Ford’s innovations in the 20th century made it cheap enough to replace the horse drawn carriage (and suddenly there were no more street dung collectors providing manure for farmer’s crops…)</p> 
         <p>My company,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.visualdna.com/" target="_blank">VisualDNA</a>, sits at the intersection of (at least) four disruptive innovations that have arisen over the last five years and that are already making their impact on global society.</p> 
         <p>I believe that as these four innovations continue to evolve over the second half of this decade, they will create the perfect conditions for VisualDNA’s unique approach to understanding people to create disruptive change on a global scale, across all industry sectors.</p> 
         <p><strong>1. Big data</strong></p> 
         <p>Five years ago this term almost didn’t exist but it is now one of the fastest growing ‘most searched for’ terms on the internet (according to Google Data Trends). Analysts Wikibon predict this new sector will grow from almost nothing in 2010 to $50bn dollars by 2017. A report by PAC predicts big data will impact on every aspect of the global economy during the same period.</p> 
         <p>PAC also found that the fastest growing area of all will be in services to understand big data. Most big data is historical and transactional. Understanding personality, psychology and motivation are the missing ingredients that will enable deep understanding of intent and truly predictive analytics.</p> 
         <p>VisualDNA’s unique ability to engage users and turn their personality into digital form will be at the forefront of providing this vital information to power conventional big data.</p> 
         <p><strong>2. Psychology</strong></p> 
         <p>Psychology is undergoing a number of dramatic changes as new technology allows us to understand how the brain and personality are linked. Neuroimaging allows us to visually track the workings of the brain and identify how different responses and our emotions work at a chemical and neuron-level. Daniel Kahneman’s work on decision-making and behavioral economics is just starting to make itself felt in the mainstream and will become increasingly influential as real-time big data allows us to understand and model human responses at a macro level. Computer scientists are developing ever more sophisticated simulations and models of the brain allowing experiments and analysis to be performed, changing the way we see the brain and raising the possibility of truly understanding ‘what makes us tick’.</p> 
         <p>As this understanding develops, it will have a major impact on our understanding of people and how they behave. VisualDNA is already leading the way in understanding how individuals behave online, and through our partnerships and research we will continue to be at the forefront of these developments.</p> 
         <p><strong>3. Digital identity</strong></p> 
         <p>We spend more and more time online, and even when not online, our mobile devices give continuous information about our location and actions. We have created a new version of our self, a digital extension of our physical and emotional being that is becoming increasingly real and important — and increasingly valuable.</p> 
         <p>Our digital identity is now a major issue for consumers, pressure groups and governments.</p> 
         <p>An unexpected side-effect of the growth of the internet has seen the data brokerage industry expand enormously. Major scandals about privacy, snooping and data leakage are an almost weekly event. Both the EU and the US are moving towards regulating the data market. For different reasons, and using different methods, Russia and China are also seeking to limit the free flow of data and take ownership of consumers’ digital identity.</p> 
         <p>By 2020 I believe a major shift will have taken place in the way consumers own and control their online and offline data. A combination of regulation, consumer pressure and new technology will have created a new relationship between consumers and their online identity. Consumers will demand, and governments will enforce, their rights to their digital footprint. With this as a key part of our vision, VisualDNA is already developing the tools to allow consumers to do this and by 2020 we will aim to be the world’s most trusted place for consumers to store, protect and manage their online self.</p> 
         <p><strong>4. Internet of things</strong></p> 
         <p>Another buzzword that has gone from almost unknown to being hugely over-used in under five years. The expansion of measurement and automation across the physical space becomes increasingly personal. Wired houses and multiple sensors tracking every car on the road for instance, are vitally important to the future of our resource consumption. It is human data that will really be significant over the next few years.</p> 
         <p>68 percent of data is produced to consumers (according to IDC, 2012). VisualDNA’s ability to understand people will be central to helping businesses and consumers cope with this volume of data, and make sense of it.</p> 
         <p>By linking personality to personal data such as health, performance or mood, we will be able to show people more about who they are, why they are the way they are and who else is like them, and show businesses how to relate to consumers as individuals rather than as vague macro-level segments.</p> 
         <p><strong>Big data + psychology + digital identity + internet of things = better understanding (= a huge opportunity)</strong></p> 
         <p>VisualDNA’s disruptive potential comes from two main points:</p> 
         <p>The first is our unique position at the center of these four areas, and the way that trends in those areas will create the opportunity for our unique technology to be a solution across all these areas.</p> 
         <p>Our position at this intersection is, I believe, unique and represents a huge opportunity to create a new segment not only within the big data market but across any sector where understanding people is important. Think what a better understanding of people’s personality could do in healthcare, or in media, or in retail.</p> 
         <p>Our second advantage comes from being under the radar. Trend-spotters and investors are busily looking at and investing in all four of these major innovation areas.</p> 
         <p>But how disruptive are these technologies right now? Each one of them is hugely game-changing in its way, but the disruption has already been factored in to most companies business plans and projections. They are heavily signposted, with so many entrepreneurs and investors looking for the next big thing, a consensus has grown up about these technologies.</p> 
         <p>Perhaps they are no longer as disruptive as they were?</p> 
         <p>True disruptive innovation comes from combining existing or new technologies that are better than existing methods. To use psychology as an example, there are plenty of areas where psychology has been used for a long while – HR for instance. However, VisualDNA’s ability to combine new advances in psychological understanding with big data and multiple data sources such as wearable technology will create huge opportunities in the field of workplace culture and understanding, opening up new ways to monitor and predict performance and fit within an organizational culture.</p> 
         <p>Finally, one further point from Christensen about disruptive innovation: truly disruptive innovation tends to come from unexpected sources and is developed by new players — existing market leaders are too trapped by what works now to think of something that will replace it in the future.</p> 
         <p>These four innovations could be said to be evolutions of technology that already exists. All are important breakthroughs, and will have a huge impact in their way. For me, the most disruptive and exciting technologies are not on any investor’s radar, and are not incremental evolutions of something that already exists. They come from combining well-understood and existing trends and technologies in a way that makes the world different. They come from small companies with big visions and a hunger to create change.</p> 
         <p>Big data + psychology + digital identity + the internet of things is one of those rare situations where radically disruptive innovation can occur — a black swan just swam into view.</p>

        <p>It was after spending 10 minutes taking a “what kind of sloth are you?” quiz that I knew I had a problem.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>Those&nbsp;<a href="https://www.themuse.com/resources/the-11-best-career-quizzes-to-help-you-find-your-dream-job-1">little BuzzFeed-style quizzes</a>&nbsp;are so addictive (who doesn’t want to know more about their personality?), but unfortunately aren’t really helping any of us get further in life. (I don’t think my co-workers knowing that I’m a “cuddle sloth” is going to help us work better together.)</p> 
        <p>But, thanks to VisualDNA, us aspirational careerists who also have an unfortunate penchant for taking quizzes have a happy medium:&nbsp;<a href="https://whoami.visualdna.com/?c=us#quiz">the “Who Am I” assessment</a>.</p> 
        <p>While it’s built in a similar style to your favorite BuzzFeed quiz—a series of questions that have you choose a photo that correlates with your answer—the results of this one are actually based on a well-respected model of personality assessment called “The Big Five.”</p> 
        <div>
         <img style="line-height: 1.5em" alt="" src="https://tm-prod.global.ssl.fastly.net/uploaded/attachments/14706.png?v=e67fc1">
        </div> 
        <div></div> 
        <p>Even better? While there are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/what-your-facebook-profile-says-about-your-personality">plenty of places online where you can go to learn your Big Five personality scores</a>, VisualDNA takes it one step further and analyzes your results, explaining how the different elements combine to affect things like your outlook, composure, and resilience. In other words, actual character traits that can affect how you work—and how you can succeed.</p> 
        <div>
         <img alt="" src="https://tm-prod.global.ssl.fastly.net/uploaded/attachments/14707.png?v=c2b022">
         <p></p> 
         <div></div> 
        </div> 
        <p>So go ahead: Take 10 minutes to take a quiz and be happy knowing that, at the end, you’ll understand a little more about yourself—and be able to put it to good use.</p>

        <p>In this inspiring talk, Alex the CEO and founder of VisualDNA, shows how today’s internet is powered by naivety. &nbsp;People don’t understand the value of what they give away for free, i.e. their data. &nbsp;&nbsp;Alex paints a picture of the foreseeable future where the ‘Internet of Feelings’ transforms our interactions between each other and suggests that from it all will develop a far better connectivity and understanding between people, and a better value exchange between services and their users.</p> 
        <p>Alex Willcock was recently described by The Guardian newspaper as ‘an Internet visionary’ for his leadership of VisualDNA, one of ‘Five British Tech Companies to Watch’. Alex and his team of 150 people based in London, have pioneered a movement to combine big data and psychology to deliver better understanding across the digital ecosystem including unlocking credit to tens of millions of people.</p>

        <div> 
         <p>By Patrick Jenkins</p> 
         <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>When Douglas Merrill left Google, he made the kind of move into financial services that many believe the tech giant itself may one day make.</p> 
          <p>Mr Merrill, the internet group’s former chief information officer founded Zest Finance to develop a simple theory: that consumers’ online behaviour can be a decent proxy for their reliability in managing money. “All data is credit data,” he once told the New York Times. “We just don’t know how to use it yet.”</p> 
          <p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">Zest is one of a fast-growing coterie of financial technology companies – “fintech”, to use the jargon – that are aiming to revolutionise the way banks and other financial services companies operate.</span></p> 
          <p>Talk of&nbsp;<a title="DeepMind and NaturalMotion lead charge of London’s tech start-ups - FT.com" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/484ade12-9278-11e3-8018-00144feab7de.html#slide0" target="_blank">fintech investment is all the rage these days</a>, as banks try desperately to focus attention on a positive forward-looking agenda, and draw a line under the legacy woes. This is partly spin, of course. But investment in technology is also genuinely needed after seven years of crisis and post-crisis regulatory reform that distracted focus – and funding – away from the pipes and cables that make everything work. Who knows? Done right, it could even help prevent some of the scandals of the past. And, as with so much in the mass market internet world, it can claim to be an agent of democratisation.</p> 
          <p>Zest and companies like it claim that many people who have traditionally been denied credit – either because they lack a record of previous borrowing, or because that record is bad – will be validated by their broader approach to credit scoring. By using “big data” records sourced from individuals’ social network and internet footprints, typical credit scores can end up 40 per cent higher, Zest says.</p> 
          <p>That could be good for the lenders, who can take on more business with less risk of default, and good for the borrowers, who want the money. This data analysis can be particularly powerful in emerging markets, where families may need more money than they have to hand to school their children or start up small businesses – both vital investments for macroeconomic development.</p> 
          <p>Admittedly, some of the data mining that fintech companies carry out makes liberty campaigners jittery. On balance, though, it is refreshing to see new ideas being brought to the traditionally obscure process of granting consumer credit.</p> 
          <p>And if big data gives the industry a second leg to stand on, a third innovation is emerging from another oblique angle – and appears equally promising. A Shoreditch business called VisualDNA has been gaining rapid traction for its credit scoring of loan applicants through a form of psychometric testing.</p> 
          <p>“Not everyone has a credit score, but everyone has a personality type,” argues Alex Willcock, the company’s founder.</p> 
          <p>VisualDNA’s test, administered via a lender, is relatively quick, taking 10 or 15 minutes. The bulk of the questions ask applicants to choose pictures from a selection that can reveal their attitude to types of risk. For example, one offers pictures of a preferred leisure activity: a day out with the family, a night out partying, or a good book?</p> 
          <p>The company’s technology has been up and running for a couple of years in Russia, via&nbsp;<a title="Russia’s “Beer Bank” does credit cards – beyondbrics - Blogs - FT.com" href="http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/09/17/russias-beer-bank-champions-credit-cards/" target="_blank">Svyaznoy, a phone retailer-cum-bank</a>&nbsp;that is controlled by VisualDNA investor Maxim Nogotkov. Among the dozen or so lenders that now use the tests across half a dozen countries, some report improvements of as much as 50 per cent in loan default rates. As a result, credit scoring agency Experian and credit card company MasterCard both signed up as clients, and banks in South Africa, Turkey and Mexico are about to trial the tests.</p> 
          <p>Mr Willcock is not lacking ambition. He talks about targeting 30m borrowers out of a 1.9bn “addressable unbanked” market over the next few years.</p> 
          <p>There are some practical shortcomings – some pictures are open to interpretation, and some applicants may dodge safeguards designed to spot dishonest answers. At a macro level, too, there will be concerns. Improperly used, this kind of “fintech” could further inflate the credit bubbles in many markets to unsustainable levels.</p> 
          <p>But, like it or not, technology is the future. The world is not going back to the old order of a bank manager knowing each of his customers individually and making credit judgments on that basis. Big data and psychometric tests have the potential to replicate the personal touch, and ensure lenders know more about their customers than they ever used to.</p> 
          <p>In recent years, amid money laundering scandals, the bank maxim of “know your customer” has become all about regulatory compliance. But it should also be about making decent business decisions.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left"><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em">This year we are sending our very own Edward Weatherall over to the Queen Elizabeth II Conference&nbsp;</span>Centre in London to attend eTail Europe. Are you attending?</strong></p> 
        <p style="text-align: left"><strong></strong>eTail Europe is a conference focusing on customers, multi-platform understanding and supporting&nbsp;retail industry growth.</p> 
        <p style="text-align: left">Ed will pose and discuss a variety of significantly telling questions throughout the session, including;&nbsp;Why do we call people who walk into stores ‘customers’ and people who shop online ‘users?’&nbsp;The session will also focus on how VisualDNA is leveraging 30 years of combined Psychology,&nbsp;customer behaviour and big data to change the perceptions that retailers have of their online&nbsp;customers – moving away from clicks, visits and basket values to personality traits and behaviours.</p> 
        <p style="text-align: left">Ed will educate attendees on how people respond better to situations and proposals that match their&nbsp;personality, posing the idea that if we want to personalise and communicate effectively with people we need to know who they are and engage with them at a personal level. The presentation will address how&nbsp;retailers can combine certain personality traits and big data to equal better understanding, increased&nbsp;conversion rates and richer customer experiences.</p> 
        <p style="text-align: left">So, if you are an eCommerce or Multi-Channel Retail executive attending eTail Europe this year&nbsp;with education and customer experience in mind then don’t forget to register to attend Ed’s&nbsp;presentation.</p>

        <p>Last week, we took part in the annual <a href="http://2014.chinwagpsych.com/">Psych London</a> event hosted by Chinwag. Chinwag Psych is a full day conference covering psychology, neuroscience and behavioural economics. Its mission is to examine the rapidly changing disciplines and explore how they can be applied to business. From practical psychology-based case studies to cutting edge neuroscience, the day-long event was filled with thought-provoking presentations, panel sessions, informed Q &amp; A sessions, plus plenty of time for networking.</p> 
        <p>This year, the structure of the day was determined by four key words: persuade, analyse, optimise and anticipate. Throughout the day, engaging speakers addressed questions such as ‘How can you be more persuasive?’; ‘When you’re designing a user’s experience, how do you know what’s working?’; ‘How can you optimise your current approach to get the results you want?’; and ‘What’s next?’</p> 
        <p>Amongst the speakers were our own Client Director, Ed Weatherall, who showcased how we can predict a customer’s behaviour by understanding their individual personality, and Leigh Caldwell, Partner at <a href="http://www.theirrationalagency.com/">The Irrational Agency</a>. Leigh made a compelling argument for better use of psychometric insight within business; arguing that frequently, the value that customers place on an item can be significantly swayed by individual emotions. For example, two leather jackets may be physically identical but one of them once belonged to David Beckham. Suddenly, the value of that particular jacket has multiplied by a factor that can be hard to estimate, it being down to the emotional value a potential customer is willing to place on it. This is a perfect example of intangible value and aptly highlights the importance of understanding your customers’ emotional and psychometric drivers.</p> 
        <p>Businesses are beginning to see th<span style="line-height: 1.5em">e importance of what they can learn from behavioural science and psychology. In our view, this is the missing link in truly personalising the customer experience and will prove to be the future growth area within digital marketing as businesses seek to discover, acquire, engage and retain high value customers.</span></p>
