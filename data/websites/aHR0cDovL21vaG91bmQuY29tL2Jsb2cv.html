     <small>June 20th, 2014 by <a href="http://mohound.com/blog/author/jimena/" title="Posts by Jimena Mondragon" rel="author">Jimena Mondragon</a></small> 
     <div class="entry">
      <p>Ratings and reviews are key for app discovery. Apps with positive and enthusiastic reviews have a higher position in the App Store’s search results, this means that users more likely will download a better reviewed app. This is no news, that’s why developers manipulate their apps’ positions by posting fake ratings and reviews. It’s sort of common knowledge these days. Any five-star review is immediately suspect.<br> As it turns out, it’s suspect to Apple, too. And now the company is doing something about it.<br> For some period of time, Apple has been removing fake reviews from the App Store that have unjustly helped certain apps climb higher in the charts than they would have otherwise.<br> There was some discussion of this on a forum back in May, when a handful of developers noticed that a good chunk of their reviews went missing. None admitted to having bought reviews.<br> It’s not uncommon that developers post jobs on freelancer marketplaces asking for reviews, or buy them in bulk from shady providers.</p> 
      <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fakereviews1-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-626" alt="fakereviews1 (1)" src="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fakereviews1-1-300x132.jpg" width="300" height="132"></a></p> 
      <p>Other developers and writers have been complaining about this and now Apple is intervening, in some cases at least, to remove fake App Store ratings.<br> For example,an app called “Better Fonts Free…” had all of its June ratings disappear overnight. The app had a few thousand ratings. But before the change, there were well over 20,000 ratings.</p> 
      <p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Better-Font-Free-App-Store-Manipulation1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-628 aligncenter" alt="Better-Font-Free-App-Store-Manipulation1" src="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Better-Font-Free-App-Store-Manipulation1-300x277.jpg" width="300" height="277"></a><br> The only way for ratings to disappear like this would have to be from Apple’s intervention. That’s because there’s really no other way for a developer to remove their ratings, short of pulling the app down and then re-releasing it as a new application, going through Apple’s sometimes lengthy review process along the way. That was not the case here; the app was always live, but the ratings just disappeared.<br> Another explanation is that this was a bug, but that’s also not the case here, from what we’ve learned.<br> How exactly Apple hears of this fraudulent activity in the first place, however, will vary. Sometimes, the company finds evidence of manipulation or gaming itself; other times, it’s brought to Apple’s attention by others.<br> We’re not sure how Apple spotted the above app’s fraudulent behavior, but it would have been pretty obvious to anyone who looked that the developer was gaming the charts. As to whether or not this will be something that Apple formalizes into a process like it has with App Store submissions is unknown. But we’re not there yet: The App Store continues to be filled with apps that clearly still have faked ratings and reviews.<br> To all the iOS developers who actually play by the rules, though, it’s going to be good when Apple finally takes care of the whole mess of fake ratings.</p>

     <h2><a href="http://mohound.com/blog/2014/06/17/mobile-user-acquisition-trends/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Mobile User Acquisition Trends">Mobile User Acquisition Trends</a></h2> 
     <small>June 17th, 2014 by <a href="http://mohound.com/blog/author/carlos/" title="Posts by Carlos Mondragon" rel="author">Carlos Mondragon</a></small> 
     <div class="entry">
      <p>Here are the mobile user acquisition trends from last week’s <a href="http://grow.co">Grow.co</a>’s Mobile User Acquisition Conference took place in Vegas. This is a short write up from my personal notes with the highlights and trends discussed by User Acquisition (UA) experts.</p> 
      <p><a href="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/User-Acquisition-_Workshop.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-615" alt="user acquisition trends" src="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/User-Acquisition-_Workshop-1024x640.jpg" width="474" height="296"></a></p> 
      <p>Most of the talks were about how to invest in a smarter way the UA budgets.</p> 
      <p>I grouped the points in 4 sections: Acquisition, Retention, Monetization and Best Practices.</p> 
      <h2 id="acquisition-trends">User Acquisition Trends</h2> 
      <h3 id="video-ads">Video ads</h3> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Still <em>very</em> new, that makes it expensive and recommended mostly for brands.</li> 
       <li>Best providers: AdColony, Vungle and Facebook.</li> 
       <li>If you are going to go this route you must have a good story to tell within 15 seconds, otherwise don’t waste your money.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <h3 id="native-ads">Native ads</h3> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Everybody’s happy with this new format of ads, results are promising.</li> 
       <li>Given it’s native form, standardizing media formats will be a challenge. Publishers have been adopting Facebook format (Caption + 1200×627 image).</li> 
       <li>The less your ad looks like an ad, the better performance it will have. But don’t deceive! This has proven true for native ads.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <h3 id="networks">Networks</h3> 
      <ul> 
       <li>The next big properties to advertise in will probably be messaging apps (Kakao, Line, Tango, Kik, etc.) with their massive user base served through native ads. People are expecting big things from Twitter and Yahoo! as well.</li> 
       <li>The better the targeting the better the quality of users. This is what makes FB king. UA managers invest around 30% if their budgets in Facebook.</li> 
       <li>Incentivized traffic is a viable option given the massive volume it can get. This is a “<em>spray and pray</em>” strategy where you might hit great quality users under all those cheap downloads. Worth a try IMHO.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <h2 id="retention-trends">User Retention Trends</h2> 
      <p>Retention campaigns have the higher ROI since they are targeted to users who already have showed strong interest into the appby downloading it. They are focused in activating, engaging and monetizing users of your app.</p> 
      <h3 id="retargeting-campaigns">Retargeting campaigns</h3> 
      <ul> 
       <li>They take a large amount of advertiser’s budgets. It depends on the specific objectives but it’s around 30–40%.</li> 
       <li>FB Custom and Lookalike audiences are providing good results. Other 3rd party data providers like <a href="http://www.acxiom.com">Acxiom</a> have provided mixed results.</li> 
       <li>You only need a set of IDFA’s to get started with retargeting campaigns. Advertisers seem to love <a href="http://tapcommerce.com">TapCommerce</a> for retargeting campaigns, <a href="http://actionx.com">ActionX</a> is also another strong competitor.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <h3 id="deeplinking">Deeplinking</h3> 
      <ul> 
       <li>It’s a must if you are doing email marketing.</li> 
       <li>There’s still a lack of standards but <a href="http://deeplink.me">DeepLink</a> and <a href="http://urx.com">URX</a> said they’d work together, most likely around <a href="http://applinks.org">Facebook’s</a> schema.</li> 
       <li>This is also a pretty new technique but if you want to offer the best user experience in your app you have to have deep linking.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <h3 id="push">Push</h3> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Push works great for re-engaging users, experts recommend sending between 15 and 30 notifications every month.</li> 
       <li>You kind of <em>HAVE</em> to do push notifications if you are already spending money on UA, this is a free channel that will help you a lot. The results you get from blasts are still good, if you want to be sophisticated you can use products like <a href="http://usekahuna.com">Kahuna</a></li> 
       <li>Onboarding users is crucial to get the rights to send them push notifications, you don’t want to miss this important marketing channel.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <h2 id="monetization-trends">Monetization trends</h2> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Just an idea that was around one of the largest problems today: Stop giving apps for free and follow examples like Minecraft that has made over $140M in sales by charging a premium price on a premium app. Freemium is a hard path to walk.</li> 
       <li>LTV calculation is hard, companies have come with predictive models trying to guess if users coming from a specific traffic source will be good. Yet a lot of advertisers are not tracking and attributing revenue. This is <em>CRUCIAL</em> if you plan of growing a business.</li> 
       <li>Media spend and revenue matching is not an easy task, luckily with <a href="http://mohound.com">Mohound</a> you can do that and measure ROI per ad network, country, device and even creative to improve your media spend.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Use FB for quick creative tests to figure out which ideas have the best CTR’s</li> 
       <li><em>Fully Managed</em> versus <em>Self Service</em>: Most successful apps think that UA is a core competence and therefore do not want to let a third party take over that. Yet they use agencies to try to speed up learnings on new best practices so they end up having a mixed model.</li> 
       <li>There might be some lower priced demographies that will help you increase revenue so it is worth exploring deeply across all channels and demographics. Everybody is testing everything out all the time.</li> 
       <li>Weekly creative iteration seems to be the best timeframe to get the best results.</li> 
       <li>Ads that show the latest coolest smartphone/tablet with the app running tend to have higher CTR’s.</li> 
      </ul>

      <p dir="ltr">Mozilla plans to roll out a $25 smartphone by the end of the year, the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/mozilla-to-sell-25-smartphones-1402466959">reported</a> Wednesday.</p> 
      <h2 dir="ltr">If you don’t have any customers, create them.</h2> 
      <p dir="ltr">$25 Sounds crazy, right? Actually, not so much.&nbsp;Mozilla is best known for its desktop browser, Firefox. But it also has a mobile operating system, Firefox OS. Mozilla’s big problem in getting people to use Firefox OS is that if you’re an Android or Apple iOS user enjoying the best apps available for either system, why would you ever want to switch to an upstart, unproven OS with few developers working on cool new software? You wouldn’t. And Firefox OS’ competitors already dominate the existing smartphone market—globally, in the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-v-android-market-share-2014-5">last quarter of 2013</a>, Android OS had 78% of smartphone users, Apple’s iOS had 18% and the rest was split between BlackBerry and Windows Phone.</p> 
      <p dir="ltr">So if people who already have a smartphone won’t switch to Firefox OS, how could Mozilla possibly get a bigger slice of the mobile OS pie? Simple: Create new smartphone owners.</p> 
      <p dir="ltr">The $25 Mozilla smartphone—packed with Firefox OS, of course—will be sold in emerging markets like India and Indonesia. Old-school “feature phones” still dominate in those countries because they’re ultra-cheap devices in countries where a few dollars can make the difference between poverty and sustainability. Mozilla’s bet is this: Bring smartphone prices in emerging markets down to $25, where they can compete on cost with feature phones, and people will jump at the chance to upgrade. And when they do,boom, a bunch of people are suddenly using Firefox OS, finally making it a relevant player in the global mobile OS wars.</p> 
      <p>Even if Mozilla breaks even or takes a loss on the hardware, it could eventually turn some kind of a profit on software, a model used by Amazon’s Kindle and most gaming consoles. And there are good reasons to root for Mozilla’s $25 smartphone gambit: If it’s successful, it has the potential to ignite a new wave of software entrepreneurship in emerging markets, where a comparatively small number of developers have mostly been focused on low-tech—but still impressive—apps based on SMS and WAPP. Let’s see what happens, we’ll see if this move can really become a game changer of the mobile landscape.</p>

     <small>June 11th, 2014 by <a href="http://mohound.com/blog/author/jimena/" title="Posts by Jimena Mondragon" rel="author">Jimena Mondragon</a></small>

      <h3 dir="ltr"></h3> 
      <p>In WWDC’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/?id=302">session on the new iTunes Connect</a>, Apple announced that they started offering analytics and attribution to developers through the iTunes Connect Console. This is huge, since is the first time Apple is taking seriously&nbsp;mobile analytics.</p> 
      <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/itunes-connect-logo-r225x.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-597" alt="itunes-connect-logo-r225x" src="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/itunes-connect-logo-r225x.png" width="203" height="203"></a></p> 
      <h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Analytics</h3> 
      <p dir="ltr">Through iTunes Connect, developers are now able to track all relevant metrics for acquisition, engagement and retention.</p> 
      <p dir="ltr">This is what developers can track through iTunes Connect:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr">App Store Views ( impression)</p> </li> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr">App Units ( number of sales, or the number of apps downloaded for one user account)</p> </li> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr">Installs (through different devices from the same user)</p> </li> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr">Sessions</p> </li> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr">Active Devices</p> </li> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr">Retention</p> </li> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr">Stickiness (a single metric which combines acquisition and retention)</p> </li> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr">In-App Purchases</p> </li> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr">Average sales (Average Revenue Per User)</p> </li> 
      </ul> 
      <h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Attribution</h3> 
      <p dir="ltr">Apple is taking on the attribution space by allowing Provider ID Campaign ID, an addition to the App Store URL which allows developer to track the source of any install. Developers can obviously break down all the metrics and parameters mentioned above by acquisition provider and specific campaign in order to assess the quality and success of their campaigns.</p> 
      <p dir="ltr">Apple finally enter the analytics and attribution space and it will definitely keep an eye on how this reflects in the whole mobile industry.</p>

     <small>June 10th, 2014 by <a href="http://mohound.com/blog/author/jimena/" title="Posts by Jimena Mondragon" rel="author">Jimena Mondragon</a></small> 
     <div class="entry">
      <h1 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/0d246de.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-590" alt="0d246de" src="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/0d246de-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199"></a></h1> 
      <h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">What you do when you wake up in the morning sets the tone for the entire day.</h2> 
      <p dir="ltr">And yet, if you are like most people, you spend it battling your alarm, anxious about what the day holds, distracted by things you know you should do later. Here are 7 things that successful people do at the beginning of the day to set them up for a great day.</p> 
      <h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">1. They meditate to lower stress</h2> 
      <p dir="ltr">Did you know that the most stressful time of the day is actually first thing in the morning? This is when our cortisol levels are the highest, which is partially responsible for things like morning rage. Meditation can help you clear away these feelings and center your mind to start the day in a calm place.</p> 
      <h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">2. They exercise</h2> 
      <p dir="ltr">We need our bodies to perform a variety of functions for us throughout the day, so give your body a stretch first thing in the morning to get it ready for what’s ahead. This is especially crucial if you are going to be sitting at a desk all day.</p> 
      <h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">3. They plan their day</h2> 
      <p dir="ltr">This can be done either the night before or in the morning. Check your list of To Dos and figure out what are the most important actions for your day. Schedule them out, with a bit of buffer time.</p> 
      <h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">4. They quick check their email</h2> 
      <p dir="ltr">It’s important to check in with your team at the beginning of the day to make sure that everyone has what they need to have a fulfilling, productive day. However, don’t “fall” into an email pit and spend the whole morning on email: set a time limit (say, 15-20 min) and address only the most important emails at that time.</p> 
      <h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">5. They “plant the seeds” for tough projects</h2> 
      <p dir="ltr">Take time to start working on extensive tasks. Don’t try to do it all one day before, if you start work a bit on the most challenging tasks daily you will accomplish so much more.</p> 
      <h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">6. They avoid distractions</h2> 
      <p dir="ltr">As tempting as it might be to pop in on Facebook or get that one remaining chore done, it’s usually a good idea to eliminate distractions so that you can focus on the important work. Make time for distractions later on the day.</p> 
      <h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">7. They make it all a habit</h2> 
      <p dir="ltr">Habits are all about efficiency. If you do the same routine you will get the results you want plus you will spend less mental energy doing that routine because it has become automatic. That mental energy can be used for the important pursuits in your life.</p>

      <h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/images.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-461" alt="images" src="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/images-300x158.jpg" width="300" height="158"></a></h3> 
      <h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">1. Finish one major task</h3> 
      <p dir="ltr">Set yourself a time limit, and at least finish one big task on Friday. This will make you have a successful end of the week and you will be satisfied with your work instead of keep on worrying the unfinished tasks during the weekend.</p> 
      <h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">2. Finish off mindless tasks</h3> 
      <p dir="ltr">Friday is a great day to do routine tasks. This could be anything from tidying up digital files, to working on reports, minutes, performance assessments, and accounting.</p> 
      <p>By doing this, you are freeing up Monday and the rest of the week when these could be irritating obstacles to one of your top priorities. A missed deadline could creep up on you.</p> 
      <h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">3. Plan the week ahead</h3> 
      <p dir="ltr">Make a to do list now, rather than on Monday morning when you may be overwhelmed with all the things you need to do next week. When planning the week ahead, keep in mind that Mondays and<a href="http://blog.accountemps.com/15-tips-for-boosting-your-productivity"> Tuesdays are the most productive days at work,</a> so plan the most difficult tasks for then. With the to do list made, you can easily cut it by 50% so that you are left with the top priorities for the coming week.</p> 
      <h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">4. Have meetings for later in the week</h3> 
      <p dir="ltr">If you decide on meetings, it is better to leave Mondays free, unless the meetings are high priority ones.&nbsp; Having meetings later on the week will help you focus Monday on other tasks and have time to prepare for all the meetings.</p> 
      <h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">5. Make Friday an email-free day</h3> 
      <p dir="ltr">Consider what many companies have done by banning all internal emails on Fridays. Everybody gets more work done. You can benefit enormously from this. Also, don‘t send important mails, it‘s better to send them at them Monday morning so your recipient would definitely read and pay attention to your message.</p>

     <div class="entry">
      <h2 dir="ltr">This is a David and Goliath type of story.</h2> 
      <p dir="ltr">Some years ago there were not as many big companies winning the larger share of the mobile market, but now large corporations have adopted an increasingly hefty presence within that industry. This means independent developers and startups are in direct competition with much bigger, capitalized and established companies. There are many Davids and some Goliaths.</p> 
      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3827693174_2b3a28ecbf.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-542" alt="3827693174_2b3a28ecbf" src="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3827693174_2b3a28ecbf-300x196.jpg" width="300" height="196"></a></p> 
      <p dir="ltr">But as Malcolm Gladwell said “Giants are not what we think they are. The same qualities that appear to give them strength are often the sources of great weakness.” Here are some ideas to help small developers on how to deal with Goliath:</p> 
      <h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Embrace being small</h3> 
      <p dir="ltr">Take advantage of the low costs of developing an app. Mobile apps are easily brought to market, the field is wide open for small startups or single developers. Plus, you can be as flexible as you can, while large companies can be less innovative. &nbsp;A new idea might have to go through several layers of approval before developers are even allowed to start working on it. In the time it takes them to get off the ground, you may be able to improve your app and submit new versions of your product faster.</p> 
      <h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Use the big guys to your advantage</h3> 
      <p dir="ltr">Many successful apps have shared stories about how they were discourage on the earlier stages &nbsp;of developing an app because either Apple or some other big company might develop something similar, but as mobile is still a pretty wide and flexible industry in the early stages, perseverance and commitment are a most. &nbsp;Mobile phones already had a message application but this did not stopped other like Whatsapp to change and even shaped the development of messaging.</p> 
      <h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Don’t forget the basics</h3> 
      <p dir="ltr">Differentiate. Although there are millions of apps, make an app so unique that stands out the rest. You can have a great app even in markets that appeared to be saturated. Create, test and promote, even the smaller budgets can get you new users and help you scale ranks in the App Store.</p>

      <h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Can mobile ads be less annoying?</h2> 
      <p>&nbsp;</p> 
      <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/app-discovery.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-387" alt="app-discovery" src="http://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/app-discovery-300x166.jpg" width="300" height="166"></a></p> 
      <p><a href="https://mohound.com/native-mobile-ads/">Mobile ads</a>&nbsp;are not yet working their full potential. A research study from Forrester, commissioned by the app-recommendation company <a href="http://www.tapjoy.com/">Tapjoy</a>, finds that mobile users find mobile ads annoying. But Smartphone app user behavior creates an attractive ad environment, here are some tips to get more out of mobile ads.</p> 
      <ol> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Understand the In-App Context</strong></p> </li> 
      </ol> 
      <p dir="ltr">If you are targeting users inside of an app, it’s important to&nbsp;understand how and when they use the app. Interrupting a moment of entertainment or utility will usually backfire as an advertising opportunity, so choose the best time within the app experience.</p> 
      <ol start="2"> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Make It Easy, Make It Fast</strong></p> </li> 
      </ol> 
      <p dir="ltr">Just like a good mobile app, you should focus on fast displaying ads, such as <a href="https://mohound.com/rich-media-ads/">mobile video ads</a>&nbsp;of 10 seconds. This type of ads, along with interstitials are likely to give you better results.</p> 
      <ol start="3"> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Don’t waste users’ attention&nbsp;</strong></p> </li> 
      </ol> 
      <p dir="ltr">Consumers realize that advertising is one of the tradeoffs of using free apps, but still ads are annoying. &nbsp;We recommend incentivizing users to engage with ad content by making offers according the context of the given app and with the nature of the brand itself. &nbsp;This is an opportunity to do more than asking users for attention, but to show them that the brand or your app is relevant.</p> 
      <ol start="4"> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Use Data to Make Ads&nbsp;<a href="https://mohound.com/blog/2014/05/20/trend-for-mobile-programatic-buying-and-contextual-data/">Contextual</a></strong></p> </li> 
      </ol> 
      <p dir="ltr">And all that data about users collected from Facebook and other social media? Use it to match a user’s interests with the appropriate offers, this may not be an easy task but take advantage of new technologies to make the most out of data.</p> 
      <ol start="5"> 
       <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Use Apps to Target&nbsp;</strong></p> </li> 
      </ol> 
      <p dir="ltr">Apps themselves are wonderful to target highly specific users. Apps are media. There is probably a sweet spot of mid-sized apps that have particular enough user profiles, use this data to build better targeted campaigns.</p>

     <div class="entry">
      <p dir="ltr">The business of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/31/yes-the-ios-app-store-still-makes-developers-more-money/">making money from apps</a> is going to get tougher, Gartner predicted that through to 2018 less than 0.01% of consumer mobile apps will be considered a financial success by their developers. This is a very rough landscape. So, how can an app succeed and actually make money?</p> 
      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. Master your app discovery</strong></p> 
      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/app-discovery.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-275 aligncenter" alt="app-discovery" src="https://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/app-discovery.jpg" width="432" height="239"></a></p> 
      <p dir="ltr">Both <a href="https://mohound.com/apple-app-store/">Apple’s</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://mohound.com/google-play/‎">Google’s stores</a>&nbsp;now each have more than one million apps . It’s the very definition of a crowded playing field, and it’s pushing mobile users to take shortcuts to help them determine which apps to download.</p> 
      <p dir="ltr">You can’t just rely on your app, but you should look for recommendation engines, friends, social networking, rather than sorting through the thousands of mobile apps available.</p> 
      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Choose the right monetization model</strong></p> 
      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/appmonetization.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-276 aligncenter" alt="appmonetization" src="https://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/appmonetization.jpg" width="278" height="181"></a></p> 
      <p dir="ltr">By 2017, Gartner predicts that 94.5% of downloads will be for free apps. So, let’s say freemium will be the more popular model. However in-app purchasing, a major growing mobile monetization strategy, is not as easy to implement. There are several factors including the purchasing habits of the target audience and the type of application to consider and making it a successful strategy.</p> 
      <p dir="ltr">The other model is &nbsp;affiliate or referral apps, this model has the advantage that app recommendations have a more integrated and natural feel within the app, but they are actually closer to be ads. This take us to the last point: Are ads really necesary?</p> 
      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. &nbsp;Navigate the Mobile Advertising landscape</strong></p> 
      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/adnetworks.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-90 aligncenter" alt="adnetworks" src="https://mohound.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/adnetworks.jpg" width="364" height="273"></a></p> 
      <p dir="ltr">“I’ll just ignore the ads,” you tell yourself whenever you download a free app instead of paying for the no-ad version. But nobody can really ignore those ads, and somebody is clicking on them.</p> 
      <p dir="ltr">Rumor has it that Candy Crush or Clash of Clans have a 5 or 6 figure daily advertising budget. That’s some serious money, so why a successful app will pay for advertising: because it works. But mobile ads are not yet working their full potential, &nbsp;you should understand the In-App Context and choose the better creatives. You can start by having a guy that constantly makes different type of creatives, and another to test each and every +400 mobile ad networks, or you can invest in fast, data driven technologies as Mohound, to help you dominate the app landscape and actually began to make a profit.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">With mobile proving itself to be the advertising industry’s new darling it is easy to forget that &nbsp;is actually a very new, five years ago mobile practically didn’t exist. However, today smartphone penetration is growing fast, &nbsp;in the US the smartphone market is over 60% according to Nielsen figures, and one in three UK households owning tablets. App developers, brands and marketers are drastically altering the way they are thinking about mobile advertising. Here is a quick view about the major improvements to notice in mobile this year.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">More often, mobile is now seen as a key part of every brand’s advertising strategy. It’s also likely that we see a new range of mobile products on the market alongside smartphones and tablets (e.g.Google Glass, although we are still dubious about the success of this device). &nbsp;However it is clear that the improvements in connection speeds and increasing number of devices will have strong implications on publishers and brands. A whole host of new advertising formats will open up for advertisers. Mobile video is already taking off, publishers will also adapt to the mobile trend in order to take full advantage of the monetisation opportunities brought by mobile.</p> 
      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mobile Video Ads</strong></p> 
      <p dir="ltr">Consumers increasingly use their different devices for different things at different times of day. Desktops and laptops will be reserved for work, smartphones, smart watches and Google Glass for sharing and sourcing information, while tablets will be used for checking emails, reading the news, and accessing other forms of entertainment. As each is optimised differently advertisers are likely to develop specific strategies depending on the device. It is unlikely the 30 second video ad model will continue across all types of device, for example smartphones will probably use 5-10 seconds videos. We are already seeing this trend emerge with Vine and Instagram Video. On the other hand tablets are used for longer form video content, so ads on tablet will be longer mobile style ads, probably around 15 seconds, while desktop will remain at the traditional 30.</p> 
      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>New Buying And Selling Technologies</strong></p> 
      <p dir="ltr">As mobile advertising becomes more efficient and more lucrative in 2014, the way it is bought and sold will change. Cost Per Install (CPI) will become the main purchasing models with Cost Per Mille (CPM) fading into the background, as advertisers increasingly realise it’s the quality of the view that counts, not quantity. Advances in mobile payment technology will also have a big impact on advertising costs. Programmatic buying and contextual data will make advertising more effective, more expensive, but more efficient and lead to more engagements. As increasing numbers of users take to mobile devices brands will adjust their spending budgets and more money will be allocated to mobile, probably at the expense of print, display and even TV advertising.</p> 
      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>New Ads Formats</strong></p> 
      <p dir="ltr">Banner ads will increasingly fall out of favour as brands and developers discover more creative advertising solutions. Innovative rich media formats, which look completely different to standard ad formats, are already being developed. Video ad selectors are replacing traditional paywalls and video players with sharing and engagement at their core are being used to embrace mobile’s inherently social characteristics. By this time next year mobile advertising will be almost unrecognisable.</p> 
      <p>Mobile is evolving at a remarkable rate and is for my money the most exciting advertising sector to be in.</p>
