      Sometimes just&nbsp;when you think you have a good read on life, you’re blindsided with a difficult issue or obstacle – what many refer to as “a curveball.” At one time or another, just about everyone will face a curveball. Whether it’s a breakup, job loss, family issue, financial problem, health setback or other issue it’s [&amp;#8230;]

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-14380 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5714644.jpg" alt="How do you stay productive during tough times?" width="800" height="545" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes just&nbsp;when you think you have a good read on life, you’re blindsided with a difficult issue or obstacle – what many refer to as “a curveball.” At one time or another, just about everyone will face a curveball. Whether it’s a breakup, job loss, family issue, financial problem, health setback or other issue it’s hard to stay focused and productive when your personal life is in turmoil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maintaining professionalism at work or school is difficult when you’re facing personal problems &amp;#8212; especially when negative thoughts are consuming you. But, allowing&nbsp;your personal life consume your work life can result in poor productivity, mistakes and bad choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, I compiled a list a strategies that I personally use to help me stay productive during rough times. I hope you find these helpful in your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Set Priorities and Stick to Them&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When life gets rough, you need more time and energy to deal with your personal crisis. At work, understand what’s essential and most important. Limit the time you spend on non-essential tasks or busywork. Keep a prioritized to-do list and stick to it. Communicate your priorities with your supervisor often. Delegate tasks when possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Leave the Drama at Home&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a coworker confide in you about a breakup or other personal issue? Did you find the situation awkward or did the coworker become a nuisance or burden &amp;#8212; sapping your productivity? It’s okay to confide in others in whom you trust, but beware of sharing too much at the office. Eventually, you can become a workplace scapegoat and could be a target of blame for mistakes due to your “public” personal crisis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of discussing your issues with others at work, seek guidance or support from a personal friend, counselor or family member outside of work. Knowing you have a scheduled time to consult with a friend or counselor will help you resist the urge to over-share with coworkers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Schedule Your Work in Time Blocks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In times of personal crisis, it’s important to be very diligent about properly managing your time. Good time management practices help you feel more in control and reduce your stress level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An excellent time management strategy is to organize your work into blocks or chunks of time. Many of us have different types of tasks to complete such as meetings, phone calls, generating reports, creating budgets, etc. When you schedule similar tasks together, you use your time more efficiently because you’re not regularly shifting contexts. Constantly shifting contexts results in poor concentration and depletes you of energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To use this method, make a list of all your necessary tasks and then use a digital calendar to group them according to the type of task. For example, schedule meetings together; return phone calls in blocks of time; and schedule budgeting activities together. And don’t forget to schedule time to just think. It’s important to reflect and plan – not just “do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Take it Day By Day&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite adages is “This too shall pass.” I think about the times that I’ve faced challenges, family crises, illnesses and other life trials. They seemed traumatic at the time, but I’ve always emerged stronger and more resilient afterward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not everything is under your control, but when you can change the situation take positive steps to ensure a good outcome. Write down or record your goals that will set you up for success. Don’t dwell on the possibilities of a negative future. Take each day one at a time. Change doesn’t happen overnight, but you can make positive change happen over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. See the Situation from a Different Point of View&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you’re blindsided by a crisis, it helps to get some perspective on the situation. Step away from it and see it from a different&nbsp;point of view. It might not be as bad as it seems. Consider your history and learn from the past. Has this situation ever occurred in your life before? How did you handle it? Was the outcome a success? What can you do differently this time?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re feeling rattled, focus on your strengths and the things that matter; and prioritize accordingly. Build a plan to set yourself up for future success and happiness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Take Care of Your Health&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Staying healthy plays an important role in being&nbsp;productive. During stressful times it&amp;#8217;s even more important to take care of your health and well being because your immune system becomes weakened. Channel your stress and anger into healthy activities that you enjoy. Yoga, meditation and aerobic exercise such as walking, running or cycling are great ways to relieve stress and make new friends. Ensure that you&nbsp;get at least eight to nine hours of sleep every&nbsp;night and stick to a healthy diet. Make&nbsp;yourself accountable by keeping an exercise and nutrition journal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Don’t forget to Ask for Help&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seeking help from family, friends and therapists during difficult situations is a great way to heal and take your life back. Sometimes we take the burden all onto ourselves when others are ready and willing to help. Keeping feelings to yourself and taking on too much can lead to more stress, depression and anxiety. Imagine yourself as a friend in need. What would you do for that person? Most likely, your friends and family would happily do the same for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your Turn&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;How do you stay productive when you’re dealing with a personal crisis? Please share your ideas and experiences!&lt;/p&gt;

You can accomplish this by going to the Font Size selection in My&nbsp;Settings as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14182" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14182 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_text.png" alt="Text Size Setting" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Text Size Setting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Examples of the new choices are shown below (Small, Regular, Large, and Extra Large).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14187" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14187 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_smalltext.png" alt="LifeTopix Small Text Example" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Small Text Example&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14186" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14186 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_medtext.png" alt="LifeTopix Medium Text Example" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Medium Text Example&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14185" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14185 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_largetext.png" alt="Large Text Example" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Large Text Example&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14188" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_xlargetext.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14188" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_xlargetext.png" alt="Extra Large Text Example" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Extra Large Text Example&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Setting &amp;#8211; Automatically Remove Complete Items from Hot List&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your Hot List contains your “Favorites.” It displays your most commonly used categories and items allowing you to quickly access them. Using the Hot List saves you time in navigating to frequently used items or categories. For example, if you created a Log Form for logging activities related to Triathlon training, you could add this form directly to the Hot List so you can quickly access it every time you complete a new training item, such as a run, biking session, or swimming session. You can access the Hot List from the left navigational pane of the main view by tapping Hot List.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is now an option in My Settings that allows you to choose whether or not completed items are automatically hidden from showing in the Hot List as shown in the example below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14192" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14192 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_hotlist.png" alt="New Hotlist Setting" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;New Hotlist Setting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Setting &amp;#8211; Account Transactions Display Order&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In My&nbsp;Settings, you can now determine the order (Ascending or Descending) of transactions. These transactions are found in the Finances topic when you access an account and view the transactions associated with the account. This option is shown below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14194" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14194" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_transactions.png" alt="Transactions Setting" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Transactions Setting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;An example of Descending Transactions is shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14195" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14195" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_Descending.png" alt="Descending Transactions" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Descending Transactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;An example of Ascending Transactions is shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14196" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_ascending.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14196" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_ascending.png" alt="Ascending Transactions" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ascending Transactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Setting &amp;#8211; Themes for Graph View&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In My Settings, you can now choose a dark or light background for graphs that are available in the Health + Goals topic. This option is shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14198" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14198" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_darklight.png" alt="Dark and Light Graph Theme" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Dark and Light Graph Theme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Examples of the dark&nbsp;and light&nbsp;themes for graphs are shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14199" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14199" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_Dark.png" alt="Dark Theme Graphs" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Dark Theme Graphs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14200" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14200" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_Light.png" alt="Light Theme Graph" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Light Theme Graph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Setting &amp;#8211; Default Task Creation Type for New Repeat Schedules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;For tasks, there are different methods for creation of repeat schedules. You can create all the tasks at once or you can ask the app to only create the following task in a series when the previous task is completed or cancelled. Now, you can set the default behavior in My Settings by using the choices shown in the example below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14202" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14202" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AutomaticallyWhenNeeded.png" alt="Task Settings" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Task Settings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum Text Items in a Locker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Bookmarks + Lockers topic, you are now allowed to add up to 12 text-based items to a locker. Previously, the maximum number was seven.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Photos to Payments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Finances topic, you are now allowed to add photo(s) to a payment. This allows you to take photos of receipts, invoices or other supporting information associated with a&nbsp;payment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can accomplish this by accessing&nbsp;the payment and tapping Add Photos at the bottom of the Payment view and adding a photo, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14204" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14204" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PaymentPhoto.png" alt="Payment Photo" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Payment Photo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New Graph Ranges&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Health + Goals topic, date ranges are now available when viewing graph data from activities, etc. You can view data from the last week, last 30 days, last 60 days, last 90 days, or last year. An example is shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14205" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14205" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_graphs.png" alt="Graph Ranges" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graph Ranges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, labels for multi-metric graphs now show labels on the Y-axis for forms that contain items&nbsp;with the same types of units. The new labels&nbsp;are shown in the example&nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14248" style="width: 573px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14248 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Graphs.png" alt="Multi-metric Graph" width="563" height="800" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Multi-metric Graph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Text Message Sharing of Checklist Items&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can now share checklists via text message with items included in the text message up to 140 characters. Simply choose the checklist you wish to share, then tap Share and select Text Message as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14206" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_Vert_textmessage1.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14206" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_Vert_textmessage1.png" alt="Checklist Text Message" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Checklist Text Message&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The text message appears as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14207" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14207" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_textmessage.png" alt="Text Message Checklist" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Text Message Checklist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Reminder Sets – Custom Templates for Local Notification Sets&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can now&nbsp;create&nbsp;custom local notification sets for items such as social events, meetings, and other items you wish to remember. This way, you can set several notifications for items at specified intervals to help you remember. Custom Notification sets are available for Projects, Tasks, Appointments, Trips, Visits, Events, and Reminders. To create a reminder set, access&nbsp;the item for which you wish to create a reminder set; tap the iOS Calendar tile, and then select&nbsp;Custom Notification Sets as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14255" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14255" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Custom-Notification-Sets.png" alt="Custom Notification Sets" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Custom Notification Sets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Custom iOS Notification Sets screen appears (as shown below), which allows you to create custom notification sets. Simply tap the plus sign to get started.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14215" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14215 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_Vert_reminderset21.png" alt="Custom iOS Notifications Set" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Custom Reminder Set&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the New Notification Set view, tap the plus sign to create a notification set. From the New Notification Criteria list, you can select three criteria for the alerts, which include a number; minutes, hours or days; and before or after (the item). An example is shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14211" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14211 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_Vert_reminderset4.png" alt="New Notification Criteria" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;New Notification Criteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;After you save the reminder sets and the item for which you wish to add the items, you must add the reminder set to the item. Add the set by tapping the iOS Calendar tile for an appointment or other item, and then tap&nbsp;Manage iOS Notifications as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14256" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14256" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Manage-iOS-Notifications.png" alt="Manage iOS Notifications" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Manage iOS Notifications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the iOS Notifications view appears, tap the plus sign and choose the reminder set that you created from the list of selections as shown below. Keep in mind that you cannot add reminder sets to items in the past. In addition, you must add reminder sets individually to items (they do not apply to each item in a recurring series.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14216" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14216" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_ReminderSets.png" alt="Reminder Sets" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Reminder Sets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pro Contacts Pack Enhancements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’ve purchased the Pro Contacts Pack, you can enjoy the following enhancements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact Logs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the People + Services topic, you can now create contact logs for your contacts to keep track of when and how you contacted them. Simply open a contact record in your LightArrow app, and you’ll see a new section called, “Contact Log” as shown in the following example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14257" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14257" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ContactLog11.png" alt="Contact Log" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Contact Log&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;To add items to the Contact Log, Simply tap the new section shown in the image above to access the Contact Log for the contact. There are several options available in this section. The Quick Log, shown below, allows you to quickly add a date and time (as the current time). This includes choices for email, text, Facebook, Twitter, and phone calls. The call log also includes the ability to add free-form text, audio, video, photos, and drawings. You can also reorder the items by tapping the Reorder icon in the top-right section. In addition, you modify the text and journal time of any Quick Log that you create by tapping it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14219" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14219 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ContactLog2.png" alt="Quick Log" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Quick Log&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call Lists&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the People + Services topic, you can now add a list of people to contact&nbsp;directly from your list of contacts (similar to a checklist). To begin, simply tap the Call Lists tile in the People + Services topic, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14220" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14220" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_SalesCalls1.png" alt="Call Lists Tile" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Call Lists Tile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the Call Lists view appears, tap the plus sign. The following view&nbsp;appears allowing you to select&nbsp;contacts you wish to call, email or text. In addition, you can contact them directly from your&nbsp;Call List.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14221" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14221 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_SalesCalls2.png" alt="Calls List" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Calls List&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional Information and Computed Metrics for Contacts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Grid view (Spreadsheet-Like view) for contacts now provides additional information for contacts including Last Contact (date and time of last contacted); Task Owner (number of open tasks); Tasks For (number of open tasks); and Since Last Contact (computed number of days since last contacted). To see this new information, tap the Filter icon at the top left of the grid view and then switch the slider to ON for&nbsp;the options shown below (with the blue slider set to Show).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14222" style="width: 573px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14222" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPad_ContactFilters.png" alt="Filters for Computed Metrics" width="563" height="800" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Filters for Computed Metrics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;An example of the new options with computed metrics is shown below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14223" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPad_Contacts_Computed.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14223" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPad_Contacts_Computed.png" alt="iPad Contacts" width="600" height="426" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;iPad Contacts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Filter Settings to Utilize Last Contacted Date&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The options in the following section&nbsp;are very useful when you’re managing sales leads, clients and other types of contacts with your LightArrow app. You can now filter on the number of days since you last contacted someone in your list by setting a filter. To create the new filter, access the Contacts view, choose the Filter drop down, and tap New Filter as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14258" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14258" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/FilterContacts.png" alt="New Contact Filter" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;New Contact Filter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next,&nbsp;add a title and comment for the filter, and then tap the New Criteria button in the New Filter view. Choose an Attribute from the list such as &amp;#8220;Last Contact&amp;#8221;; choose an operator such as Equals, Not Equals, Less Than, Greater Than or Contains; and then choose a value (such as the number of days).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An example of a filter for number of days exceeding 5 for last contact date/time is shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14225" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14225 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/contactfilter.png" alt="Contact Filter Criteria" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Contact Filter Criteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you select this filter in the Contacts view, you can easily locate clients, potential clients, or other contacts that you have not contacted in a specified period of time. An example is shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14224" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14224 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/contactfilter1.png" alt="Filtered Contacts by Number of Days" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Filtered Contacts by Number of Days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Free “Pro Work Pack” Features&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new free pack is now available for improved project and task management. The following sections describe the new features.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Task Hierarchy for Projects and Other Topics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can now create a task hierarchy for project tasks or other items in your LightArrow app. You can only work with task hierarchies within a project or other item that supports tasks. To create a task hierarchy, access or create tasks for a project or other items that support tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To get started, choose&nbsp;Group by&nbsp;Hierarchy as shown in the following example (at the left side of the view).&nbsp;After the Tasks view is displayed and the view is grouped by “hierarchy,” tap Arrange Hierarchy at the right side of the view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14226" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14226" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hierarchy1.png" alt="Task Hierarchy" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Task Hierarchy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, tap a task and choose Add New Item as a Peer or Add New Item as Child to create a new peer or child item. These options are shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14227" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14227" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hierarchy2.png" alt="Task Hierarchy, Child and Peer" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Task Hierarchy, Child and Peer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;After you create your tasks, you may wish to re-arrange them. To do so, access&nbsp;to the group of tasks via the project or other item. Tap and hold a task. You can move the task by dropping it, or you can choose Make Peer or Make Child as shown&nbsp;in the following example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14228" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14228" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hierarchy3.png" alt="Rearrange Task Hierarchy" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rearrange Task Hierarchy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Convert&nbsp;Tasks to Projects, Events, Trips, and Visitors (can add more data)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is now possible to convert Tasks to Projects, Trips, Visitors and Events. Simply access the task through the Projects + Tasks topic, then tap Convert. Select one of the choices (as shown below) and complete the conversion. This deletes the task and creates a new project, trip, visitor or event – depending upon the selection. This conversion is only available for non-recurring, single tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14230" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14230 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_6_converttask.png" alt="Task Conversion" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Task Conversion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Convert&nbsp;Appointments to&nbsp;Projects, Events, Trips, and Visitors (can add more data)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is now possible to convert Appointments to Projects, Trips, Visitors and Events. Simply access the appointment through the Events + Appointments topic, then tap Convert. Select one of the choices (as shown below) and complete the conversion. This deletes the appointment and creates a new project, trip, visitor or event – depending upon the selection. This conversion is only available for non-recurring, single appointments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14231" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14231" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ConvertAppointment.png" alt="Appointment Conversion" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Appointment Conversion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free “Pro Checklists” with Notes + Files Topic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Notes + Files topic or from the Agenda view, you can create checklists/to-do lists with mixed types of items, which are referred to as &amp;#8220;Pro Checklists.&amp;#8221; Previously, these lists only included text-based, plain lists items. Now, you can add appointments, reminders, activities, nutrition items, health stats, medication, and wellness entries to Pro Checklists. The Pro Checklist items are automatically added to your agenda.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To get started, open a checklist or create a new checklist. Next, tap Convert to Pro Checklist, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14233" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14233" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_checklist11.png" alt="Pro Checklist Conversion" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pro Checklist Conversion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you tap Convert to Pro Checklist, the following selections become available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14234" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14234 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_checklist2.png" alt="New Pro Checklist Options" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;New Pro Checklist Options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Pro Checklist can&nbsp;contain plain items, tasks, appointments, activities, medication, nutrition items, reminders and shopping items as shown in the example below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14235" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-14235 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_checklist3.png" alt="Pro Checklist" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pro Checklist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Event View Allows Direct Contact to Invitees and Co-hosts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Event View now allows you to contact invitees and co-hosts via call, text or email directly from the Event view. To take advantage of this new feature, go to an Event in the Events + Appointments topic. You will notice a section in this view with buttons for calls, text messages, and email (as shown below). Tapping these buttons allows you to automatically contact the invitees and co-hosts of the event that you planned. For email, an email is created that includes all of the invitees and co-hosts as recipients. For text and phone calls, a list of invitees and co-hosts is displayed, which allows you to contact each person individually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_14252" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-14252" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iPhone_EventSharing.png" alt="Event Communications" width="400" height="819" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Event Communications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your Turn&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the new features! Please comment and let us know if you have any questions or comments about your LightArrow app.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14265" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6953967.jpg" alt="LightArrow Stop Procrastination" width="800" height="533" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how brainy, ambitious and gifted you are, if you lack the willpower to get things done it’s difficult to achieve success. Before you give up on yourself, understand it’s natural to procrastinate. Everybody does it – some more than others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To help you&nbsp;stop procrastinating and to get things done, we compiled a list of our favorite life hacks for slaying the procrastination monster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;1. Don’t Get Stuck in Analysis Paralysis&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t overthink a project or task before you get started on it. If you dwell on&nbsp;it, no action will be taken – hence paralysis. Planning projects is important, but if you get stuck in the planning phase before you have every unknown answered, it’s impossible to move forward. Set a time limit for project planning and just get going. Answers will become apparent and blockages will be resolved as time passes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;2. Beware of High Standards&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard the quote by Voltaire, “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good?” If you fall into the trap of failing to get started on a project because you have the fear that it won’t be perfect, you’ll never get moving. I always remind myself, especially in creative endeavors, that perfection&nbsp;is subjective. My perception of perfect is completely different than&nbsp;your perception of perfect. Let go of your fear&nbsp;and move forward. Forget perfection and focus on progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;3. Work Against the Clock&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes we procrastinate on starting a project because we think we have a long time to do it. Have you ever heard of Parkinson’s Law? Cyril Parkinson, a British historian, identified this scientific law in 1955. Essentially, it identifies that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. For example, if you give yourself a week to write an essay it will essentially take the entire week instead of a more appropriate time period, such as a few hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can beat procrastination by setting a deadline for all your tasks and by determining&nbsp;the appropriate amount of time to complete them. Set&nbsp;aside the proper amount of time for your&nbsp;tasks at hand and stick to the schedule. Schedule these projects and tasks on your calendar or place them in a to-do list with an appropriate time limit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;4. Find Value in Your Projects or Tasks&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Often times we procrastinate on tasks because we don’t believe they have any value. If your tasks aren’t aligned to your goals in work and life then it’s difficult to get motivated to get started. Examine&nbsp;the value of the task. For example, perhaps you’re on the high school football team and you’re focused on becoming a professional football player. In your situation, studying for your Algebra exam might seem like a low priority; however, passing grades are required to stay on the team. Focus on the value of good grades to get started and stay motivated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;5. Break it Down&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;In work and life there’s always tasks and chores that we find mundane. It’s just a fact of life. Whether it’s doing laundry, working out, creating your weekly status report or making dinner – there’s always tasks that you can’t escape. Of course, many of us tend to procrastinate on these humdrum tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Breaking chores and tasks into smaller chunks is a great way to tame the procrastination beast. The task or chore doesn’t seem as daunting if you break it down. For example, don’t create your weekly status report one hour before it’s due on Friday afternoon. During the week, add your accomplishments to the status report as you complete them. This way, you can reward yourself with a less stressful Friday afternoon at the office, and also make it home on time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;6. Get Started When Your World is Asleep&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#8217;ve given into procrastination, a trick that I personally use to get back on track is to shift my schedule and complete daunting tasks late at night or early in the morning when everyone else is sleeping. This way, I’m completely uninterrupted by phone calls, barking dogs, email, meetings or other distractions. This strategy helps me to laser focus on the task and finish it well before the deadline. I recommend using this strategy sparingly because lack of sleep can be a significant deterrent to getting things done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;7. Control Impulses&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s difficult to control impulses or urges to do something more entertaining than the tasks we know we need to do. For example, how often do you find yourself watching videos, playing games or reading Twitter posts instead of getting started on an important project or task?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Web MD Impulse Control" href="http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/got-impulse-control" target="_blank"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;explains that some of us tend to give into impulses easier than others due to the coordination between&nbsp;the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right orbitofrontal cortex. Furthermore,&nbsp;studies concluded that teenagers with less volume in the right orbitofrontal cortex might be more susceptible to lack of impulse control, such as alcohol abuse. The same article explains that it’s never too late to improve impulse control. Marc N. Potenza, MD recommends that you give yourself&nbsp;a small, healthy reward that will lead to a bigger payoff later when you don’t give into your impulses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;8. Work a To-do List into Your Daily Routine&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re prone to procrastination, creating a to-do list should be automatic as brushing your teeth every day. Working a to-do list into your daily routine can be key to getting things done. I recommend that you create your to-do list the night before so you’re ready to get started each morning without delay. A daily to-do list usually consists of approximately three to five tasks to complete every day. Immediately start with the most difficult task on your list. This way, you’re working on the task that requires the most energy when you’re fresh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our starter productivity app, &lt;a title="My.Agenda App Store" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my.agenda-start-calendars/id619281596?mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;My.Agenda&lt;/a&gt;, is a great way to get started with making a daily to-do list in a digital format with an iPhone or iPad.

Getting things done is embedded in everything we do. We often share productivity tips on our &lt;a title="Life Blog" href="http://lightarrow.com/blog" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="LightArrowInc on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/LightArrowInc" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="LightArrow on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/LightArrowInc" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Today, we compiled a collection of our favorite, counter-intuitive tips. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Ditch the Late Night Emails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does your boss send you late night emails? Studies show that answering email outside of work on your smartphone or tablet, especially late at night, makes you less productive. Here’s the science involved. The pineal gland, which is located in the brain, releases melatonin a few hours before you go to sleep. However, if you’re playing games or using tablets and smartphones, the blue light that these devices emit can prevent the gland from releasing the melatonin you need to get to sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But before you completely unplug, ensure&nbsp;you understand your boss’s expectations and that&nbsp;you know when immediate responses are necessary. Or perhaps, you&amp;#8217;re the boss. Keep in mind that your employees feel obligated to respond, which sets them up for poor sleep and less productivity. Keep your employees happy and healthy by reserving&nbsp;the late night emails for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Smile More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever spent a day dwelling on a negative event? Do you remember the impact it had on your overall productivity? Examine the things that make you happy and learn to gravitate to those places, people and things. When you’re happy, you’re naturally more productive and creative. Numerous studies have been conducted that link improved job performance and productivity with overall happiness. So don&amp;#8217;t be a &amp;#8220;Debbie Downer&amp;#8221; and be afraid to share&nbsp;your happiness with&nbsp;everyone around you. Your smile will certainly be contagious!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Put a Plant on Your Desk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;A little greenery can go a long way. Adding a plant to a sparse office space can surprisingly increase your productivity. According to a study published in the &lt;a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-30837-001/" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology&lt;/a&gt;, plants can increase productivity up to 15 percent!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, plants can remove air pollution from your environment&nbsp;that&nbsp;negatively affects productivity. According to &lt;a title="N" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Clean_Air_Study" target="_blank"&gt;NASA Clean Air Study&lt;/a&gt;, a variety of plants can reduce benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene, xylene, toluene and/or ammonia. I personally prefer Boston Ferns because they&amp;#8217;re relatively easy to take care of and they&amp;#8217;re not toxic to animals according to &lt;a href="http://www.mnn.com/family/pets/stories/house-plants-safe-for-pets" target="_blank"&gt;Mother Nature Network&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever plant you choose, it will beautify your surroundings, clean the air and make you more productive. It&amp;#8217;s a gift to yourself that doesn&amp;#8217;t stop giving!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Take Restorative Breaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;After working several hours on a difficult task, you can feel drained and lose concentration. Recharging is necessary to regain your energy and concentration. You’ve probably heard that taking breaks increases productivity. However, when you take a break, ensure that the activity you choose during that break does not impact your concentration. Playing a game on your smartphone is&nbsp;not the best choice when recharging. Instead, take a walk, stretch, do some yoga poses, eat a healthy snack or talk to a friend. Sometimes, a change of scenery is all you need to recharge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Eat Dark Chocolate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now this is a tip you can sink your teeth into. Eat Dark Chocolate! Dark chocolate contains antioxidants and caffeine, which are proven to improve mental focus and alertness. In fact, according to &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/health-by-chocolate?page=2" target="_blank"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;, researchers believe that chocolate can enhance neurotransmitters which can help with sleep and mood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Just Say No&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t try to do too much. Ruthlessly prioritizing is&nbsp;the key to achieving your goals and dreams – with the key word being “YOUR.” When you’re pulled in multiple directions and have conflicting priorities, you never achieve the things you really want to achieve. Just say no to someone else who’s trying to push his or her agenda onto you. Decide what’s important and urgent. Record your goals and build a tangible plan with broken-down tasks to get there. Check in with yourself. Review these&nbsp;goals often. Always clearly explain to others why their agenda is not your priority.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Don’t Work So Much&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed that your productivity declines on Friday afternoon? You’re gearing up for the weekend, losing focus, and burned out from a long week. According to &lt;a href="http://uk.hudson.com/friday-afternoons-off-increase-productivity-media-coverage" target="_blank"&gt;Hudson Research&lt;/a&gt;, employees who have a relaxed Friday environment “go into the weekend feeling positive about their working environment.” A flexible schedule goes a long way with most employees. Researchers from this study believe that the “feel good factor” can have beneficial effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t feel guilty. If your employer allows it, work when your energy is at its best. Take advantage of the times when you feel focused and take some time off when you believe you’re not doing your best work. The result will be better output&nbsp;and a recharged mind and body. It’s a win-win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time and time again I hear, “I don’t have time for exercise” or “I’m too tired to exercise.” I believe most of us don’t have time to NOT exercise. Exercise supplies more energy to your brain,&nbsp;and it also enhances mental capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you have a busy work schedule, small children or school is taking over your life, there’s always a way to make time to be healthy. You don’t have to join a gym or jump onto the latest hardcore workout trend. According to the &lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, you should aim for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity. That’s only 30 minutes five days a week. Worried about childcare? Take a walk with your kids so they can also enjoy the benefits of movement and activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Write More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writing can have many benefits. Writing helps you organize your thoughts, stay on schedule and release feelings onto paper. In fact, just the act of writing helps us to remember things. Do you make to-do lists? Just&nbsp;the process of making a to-do list helps you to remember all the tasks that you need to complete. Writing lists makes everything more manageable and makes you feel less out of control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Focus on the Moment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;How often do you try to plow through your to-do list and thoughts start creeping into your head about the test you need to study for&nbsp;or phone calls you need to make? To get things done quickly and efficiently, focus on one task at a time before moving onto the next task. For example, imagine you’re writing a term paper, but you know you have six loads of laundry waiting. Instead of breaking up your thought process, focus on your term paper for 90 minutes before shifting to another task, such as your laundry. You can easily set a timer with your smartphone or alarm clock to keep you focused.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Your Turn&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is your favorite unexpected life hack for making you more productive? Please share!&lt;/p&gt;

      In the 1800s, Victorinox® introduced&nbsp;the Swiss Army Knife® as an all-in-one tool to aid the Swiss Army. If you’re not familiar with the Swiss Army Knife, it’s essentially a single instrument that can include several different tool combinations such as a blade, screwdriver, can opener, bottle opener, nail file and a host of other tools.

If you’re not familiar with the Swiss Army Knife, it’s essentially a single instrument that can include several different tool combinations such as a blade, screwdriver, can opener, bottle opener, nail file and a host of other tools. The Swiss Army Knife is known for its&nbsp;multi-tool design, red color and white cross logo. It&amp;#8217;s&nbsp;an excellent example of smart and versatile design that eliminates unnecessary bulk in your backpack or pocket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;LightArrow Apps – Swiss Army Knives of the App World&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some things never change. In the 1880s, it was important to keep essential tools in one place. These days, many of us keep a variety of tools (apps) for managing our work and life&nbsp;on our smartphones and tablets. Imagine your&nbsp;device is like a&nbsp;pocket or backpack – you don’t want 24&nbsp;different apps weighing down your device when you can use just one. And just like your pocket, you don’t want to keep reaching into it to find a different tool to do the job when one tool can do it all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At LightArrow, we believe that versatility and all-in-one design is essential for optimizing productivity, and that&amp;#8217;s why we love this type of smart design. For example, if I&amp;#8217;m at a conference and I meet new connections, I want to save the information about those connections in notes, but I don&amp;#8217;t want those notes to be separate from&nbsp;contacts on my device. Or, if I create a shopping list for a home project, I want that shopping list to be associated with that project. That&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s great when my data is connected and inside one&nbsp;app.&nbsp;I also don&amp;#8217;t want to search for a different app every time I want to create a reminder or make a to-do list. For the sake of efficiency, it&amp;#8217;s important to have a &amp;#8220;go-to&amp;#8221; app for this information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-13984 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/LightArrow-Connected-App.001-001.png" alt="LightArrow Connected App.001-001" width="800" height="700" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of our&nbsp;apps are packaged much like Swiss Army Knives. You can choose &lt;a title="LifeTopix" href="http://lightarrow.com/portfolio-item/lifetopix-app" target="_blank"&gt;LifeTopix&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the most functionality in our product line right out of the box, or you can pick&nbsp;the features you want by downloading&nbsp;one of our other &lt;a title="LightArrow Products" href="http://www.lightarrow.com/products" target="_blank"&gt;products&lt;/a&gt;. These apps: &lt;a title="Pro.Calendar" href="http://lightarrow.com/portfolio-item/pro-calendar-app" target="_blank"&gt;Pro.Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="My.Agenda" href="http://lightarrow.com/portfolio-item/my-agenda-app" target="_blank"&gt;My.Agenda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="Pro.Inbox" href="http://lightarrow.com/portfolio-item/pro-inbox-app" target="_blank"&gt;Pro.Inbox&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;allow feature set&nbsp;flexibility through in-app purchases. Hence, it&amp;#8217;s much like picking the tools that you need on your Swiss Army Knife. You can learn more about the features included in each app by visiting&nbsp;our &lt;a title="Compare Our Apps" href="http://lightarrow.com/compare" target="_blank"&gt;Compare Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Your Turn&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you discovered the power and versatility of all-on-one design? Let us know about your experiences with our products or others.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether you’re an entrepreneur, solopreneur, small business owner or freelancer, the challenges are the same. It’s imperative to stay on top of your game and laser focused on your goals to attain the success you set out to achieve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you know, these days it’s important to understand new technologies and new media in order to get ahead and stay ahead of the competition. And now, more than ever before, mobile technologies have changed&nbsp;the ways&nbsp;we get things done&nbsp;every day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week, we’ve compiled a list of five technologies and systems&nbsp;that you must have in your repertoire in order to achieve success in our modern world of small business. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Nurture Small Business Sales Leads and Build Customer Relationships&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A CRM application is a great tool for simplifying the management of your small business contacts. It integrates a variety of different information about your leads, prospects&nbsp;and customers all into one place. An ideal CRM also includes project and task management, allowing you to assign sales and marketing tasks that impact your sales revenue. Typically, a cloud-based CRM will cost anywhere from US $12 monthly/person to US $125 monthly/person, not including professional services and ongoing support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;LightArrow apps include many customer relationship management features that web-based CRM systems have, &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; the monthly subscription fees. Our apps organize a variety of customers’ data that originated from multiple places into one mobile app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, our apps allow you to organize leads, track, and manage leads. You can also interact with contacts&nbsp;through email or social media handles, directly from their contact record in your LightArrow App. In addition, LightArrow apps include powerful project and task management features, which allow you to assign tasks to yourself or others to nurture prospects and move them down the sales funnel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In&nbsp;the following diagram you see &lt;a title="LifeTopix" href="http://lightarrow.com/portfolio-item/lifetopix-app" target="_blank"&gt;LifeTopix&lt;/a&gt;’s spreadsheet-like view for managing contacts. Within this view, you can access and manage all the information about your leads, prospects or clients. Specifically, you can manage all the tasks that are required to advance to a successful sale. Once the lead becomes a customer, you can manage and organize any information for this client through the &lt;a title="The 12 LifeTopix" href="http://lightarrow.com/lifetopix/the-12-lifetopix" target="_blank"&gt;12 life topics&lt;/a&gt;, included with the LifeTopix app; of course, keeping track of customer details is vital for customer retention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-13912 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SmallBizCRM.jpg" alt="SmallBizCRM" width="700" height="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Manage Small Business Assets and Finances&nbsp;Wisely&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accurately managing the assets that your company owns and leases is key&nbsp;for the success of your small business. It’s important to track IT assets, furniture, vehicles and other items.&nbsp; Asset Management software can come in many shapes and forms. You can choose simple mobile asset management or an expensive enterprise asset management system. It’s also important to manage your financial assets and finances. There are several options for managing finances from simple software to more complex accounting software. Some of the features that financial software solutions offer are expense and payment tracking, receipt scanning, invoicing, etc.&nbsp;Foremost,&nbsp;remember to use the&nbsp;software solutions that fit the needs of your small business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These days, using a mobile solution for asset management is an important factor because it allows you to manage and update assets easily while on the go. LightArrow mobile solutions are a great choice for the small business, entrepreneur or solopreneur. Imagine your business includes a fleet of automobiles. &lt;a title="LifeTopix" href="http://lightarrow.com/portfolio-item/lifetopix-app"&gt;LifeTopix&lt;/a&gt; is an ideal app for managing the details for each automobile asset. You can keep track of purchase dates, cost, current value, manufacturer, model serial numbers, SKUs, vehicle identification numbers (VINs), locations (map included), and categories. In addition, you can associate tasks, appointments, reminders, notes, checklists, online/local files, bookmarks, expenses, services, audio, photos or videos with each vehicle (or other asset). An example of how you might use LightArrow apps for asset management is shown below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-13916 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SmallBizAsset.jpg" alt="SmallBizAsset" width="700" height="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re a business owner who’s often on the go, LightArrow apps also offer solutions for managing finances while mobile. LightArrow mobile apps include&nbsp;tracking of financial information including expenses, payments, accounts, banking information, service payment templates, charitable donations, financial asset management and financial notes. With LightArrow apps, you can associate financial information with other items you manage in your app, such as assets. For example, in the graphic below, you will see that an&nbsp;expense is associated with an asset, which is a vehicle. Another popular feature for small business owners is the ability to set up Payment Templates with recurring payments; an example is also shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13938" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SmallBizFinances.jpg" alt="SmallBizFinances" width="700" height="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Make Social Media a Habit in&nbsp;Small Business&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In today’s changing world, social media is vital for small business success. In fact, according to a study conducted by LinkedIn, 3 in 5 SMBs have acquired new customers via social media. There are a variety of ways to manage and monitor social media. You can use the free tools from the social media sites, such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn all the way to using a full-fledged social media management tool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Social media management tools provide features such as keyword monitoring and listening, all-in-one views of social media accounts, scheduling, ways to engage with others, and in some cases, further analysis and recommendations. If you want all of this functionality and more from a hosted social media management system, it will cost you a monthly subscription fee that is typically charged by the number of users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Social media is a commitment that will reap rewards over time. Before jumping into using an expensive social media management tool, I recommend that small businesses use free and inexpensive apps and web applications to manage their social media profiles and engagement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At LightArrow, our apps include a social media dashboard and listening via keywords through Feed Accounts. You can set up feed accounts for Facebook and Twitter; and also for Email and Evernote®. You can listen for product or company mentions, and you can stay on top of your industry by creating streams with the keywords in which you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-13913 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SmallBizSocialMedia.jpg" alt="SmallBizSocialMedia" width="700" height="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a title="Pro.Inbox" href="http://lightarrow.com/portfolio-item/pro-inbox-app"&gt;Pro.Inbox&lt;/a&gt; app, shown above, has this keyword listening functionality built in. With &lt;a title="My.Agenda" href="http://lightarrow.com/portfolio-item/my-agenda-app" target="_blank"&gt;My.Agenda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="LifeTopix" href="http://lightarrow.com/portfolio-item/lifetopix-app" target="_blank"&gt;LifeTopix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="Pro.Calendar" href="http://lightarrow.com/portfolio-item/pro-calendar-app" target="_blank"&gt;Pro.Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, you can purchase this option via in-app purchase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What makes our apps unique over the typical Social Media Management tool is you can convert the tweets and posts that you find into actionable items such as tasks, notes, events, appointments and more. For example, you might see an industry article that you believe is important to read in&nbsp;a Twitter feed. You can convert this item to a note and add a date tag to schedule it on your calendar. These items can be pushed to your iOS calendar, which in turn propagates to all the calendars that you’ve associated with your iOS calendar, which takes small business productivity to a new level. It’s important to note that this feature also applies to email and Evernote feeds, which allows you to accomplish “Inbox Zero” easily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Unify Small Business Calendars, Reminders, Tasks and Checklists&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keeping a master schedule is important for your small business. It&amp;#8217;s difficult to choose the right calendar app for your business schedule because there are so many choices available. All of these calendars and to-do list apps have their own unique bells and whistles. The&nbsp;apps you choose depend on your personal preference and business needs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At LightArrow, we focus on productivity. That’s why we combined tasks, reminders, to-dos and eight calendar styles into one app view – with fast switching and beautiful styling. We’ve made our calendar views easy to read and they’re very simple to set up. As soon as you grant access to your iOS calendars that you use on your iPhone or iPad, your LightArrow app shows the events from those calendars. And as a bonus, your LightArrow calendar also includes your iOS reminders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-13914 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SmallBizCalendar.jpg" alt="SmallBizCalendar" width="700" height="600" /&gt;&nbsp;In the graphic above, you will notice Overdue, Undated and Checklist sections shown in the Agenda view. These sections include everything from overdue tasks, undated tasks; open shopping items; iOS reminders; and checklists/to-do lists. Combining these items prevents you from hopping from app to app. You will also notice the comprehensive Month view, which enables you to see all your calendar items easily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Manage Small Business Projects Like a Pro&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Managing your projects without the right tools is like fixing a clogged drain with a Q-tip. The more and more you push; you’re never going to get anywhere. There are a lot of options for managing projects and tasks. Some cloud&nbsp;applications are free for a limited number of users and others require subscription fees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;LightArrow apps are excellent for individual and small team project and task management. The advantage of using LightArrow apps for project and task management is because the projects are integrated with the features discussed in this post, as well as other items, such as appointments, reminders, expenses, services, online notes and files and more. This prevents you from hopping from app to app to find the information that you need. Small business owners appreciate the ease of creating tasks and easily emailing them to a project participant, which allows delegation or task sharing. The recipient can easily open the email message; tap on the message and save the project and tasks in their instance of LifeTopix, as shown in the following example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-13934 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SmallBizProject.005.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, if you use &lt;a href="https://asana.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Asana&lt;/a&gt; for project management (which is free for up to 15 users), LightArrow Apps include task integration with this popular tool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your Turn&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please let us know in the comments how you&amp;#8217;re using your LightArrow app in your small business or if you have any questions or comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-13545 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/iStock_000018177731Small.jpg" alt="LightArrow Questions" width="849" height="565" /&gt; &lt;a href="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Pro.Inbox-App.png"&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/LifeTopix-ToDo-List.png"&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;What if I told you that the things you think are true about productivity are actually detrimental to getting things done? Let me guess. You’re doing all the right things that you believe will help you get the stuff done that you really want to do, but it’s not happening. You’re frustrated, burned out and simply tired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’ve been following the rules outlined below, consider shifting your perceptions and adjusting your work habits. These different&nbsp;ideas might enhance your productivity in ways you never thought were possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;1. Myth –&nbsp;It Pays to Work Hard – Keep Your Head Down&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you believe that working harder, better and faster is the Holy Grail for getting things done? Do you think that if you could just focus better, keep your head down and “push through” then you’ll magically produce more and more each day? If you believe&nbsp;that you’ll be an instant success when&nbsp;you eliminate breaks, get to work earlier and stay later, you&amp;#8217;re fooling yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are you the person who realizes that after a long day at work you sat at your desk or in meetings all day and never took a bathroom break? Admit it, we’ve all done it. If this is you, keep reading. Working harder and “pushing through” is a vicious cycle that leads to burnout. It takes a toll on you emotionally, psychologically and physically. Recently, a tweet caught my eye that compared prolonged sitting to cigarette smoking, stating, “Sitting is the new cigarette.” This is a powerful statement that led me to research how prolonged sitting affects the body and mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An article from the&nbsp;&lt;a title="Mayo Clinic" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/adult-health/expert-answers/sitting/faq-20058005" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;indicates that&nbsp;adults in a study that spent more than four hours a day sitting while watching a screen, had a 50 percent increased risk of death from multiple causes and a 125 percent increased risk of cardiovascular disease. If this doesn’t convince you to get up and moving, then my message isn’t compelling enough. Keep reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier I wrote a post about &lt;a href="http://lightarrow.com/why-are-your-coworkers-more-productive-than-you" target="_blank"&gt;Ultradian Rhythms&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and the science of why taking breaks enhances productivity. Taking breaks is truly a little known and surprising method for boosting problem solving, creativity and productivity. Set a timer for 90 &amp;#8211; 120 minutes. Then, take a 20-minute break after that time period ends. Experiment with this method and observe if you’re achieving the productivity benefits you&amp;#8217;re hoping for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;2.&nbsp;Myth –&nbsp;Procrastination is Bad&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m certain that during your life, you’ve come to the conclusion that procrastination is a trait that’s considered undesirable – an unwelcome guest that sneaks up and steals your productivity right out from under you. Change your perception about procrastination. Make it your friend, but not your BFF.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The key to making procrastination work for you is to first recognize it for what it is. Is there a task that needs to be done, but you’re dreading it so it’s been put on the back burner? Is there&nbsp;a daunting project looming that you don’t have the time or energy to complete? Consider how important and urgent this task or project really is. Rank it in importance of all the other projects and tasks that are present in your work and life. How will avoiding this task or project affect you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Align your goals, tasks and priorities. If the&nbsp;task you&amp;#8217;re putting off isn’t going to move the needle toward your most important goals, then put it aside – go ahead and procrastinate and stop feeling guilty. It’s not worth your&nbsp;energy. If you simply don’t have time given the other priorities in your work or life, set this task aside, outsource it or delegate it. As long as your making progress on what YOU believe are the most important or urgent tasks, then you’ve mastered the art of procrastination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;3.&nbsp;Myth&nbsp;–&nbsp;All Multi-tasking is Harmful&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the recent past, multi-tasking was&nbsp;considered a trait of highly effective people. It was a characteristic to brag about to friends and coworkers. Recently, productivity experts and researchers have flagged multi-tasking as a habit that reduces productivity and impairs intellectual ability. I agree, rapid multi-tasking is detrimental to productivity. If you’re shifting back and forth from many tasks or getting frequently interrupted, you lose focus and ultimately efficiency suffers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I never believe in extremes. A limited amount of multi-tasking can make you more efficient, depending on the type of tasks you’re executing. For example, imagine you’re a teacher and you also have children who play baseball or soccer. While you’re waiting at their practice, spend time grading papers and you’ll have more quality 1-on-1 time with your kids when you return home. Discover which tasks don’t require a lot of thought and those are the tasks that can be done in the background. Think of your brain like a computer. If you have too many processes going, it will eventually impair the performance and sometimes it shuts down. You know your&nbsp;limits; use common sense when it comes to multi-tasking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;4.&nbsp;Myth&nbsp;–&nbsp;Paper Lists Work&nbsp;Better Than Digital Lists&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_13547" style="width: 236px" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lightarrow.com/lifetopix" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-13547 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/LifeTopix-ToDo-List.png" alt="LifeTopix ToDo List" width="226" height="477" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;LifeTopix App&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve heard time and time again that many of you are unconvinced that a digital to-do list has its productivity advantages over old-fashioned sticky notes or a moleskin day planner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With an old-fashioned paper to-do list you&amp;#8217;re required to erase items when you re-prioritize or make errors, which is arduous. With a digital list, re-prioritization is usually as quick and easy as&nbsp;a tap&nbsp;and drag&nbsp;action. It’s nearly impossible to share a paper list with someone who’s not at the same location when you&amp;#8217;re delegating or sharing tasks. It&amp;#8217;s challenging to save and reuse a paper list; these lists&nbsp;inevitably get thrown away or lost. Completed tasks or to-dos that are written on paper or whiteboards cannot be searched for history purposes. Your smartphone is compact, always with you &amp;#8212; and ready while on the go. Save your time and some trees; a digital productivity app can&nbsp;boost efficiency and productivity with several benefits over paper methods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;5.&nbsp;Myth&nbsp;–&nbsp;You Must Get Up Early to be Productive&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of us have heard the old idiom, “the early bird gets the worm” – meaning those who rise early reap the benefits. Do you believe if you rose earlier you would accomplish much more? This is another myth that needs busting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone is different. Some of us do our best work in the morning, while others flourish at night. In fact, researchers at Germany’s Aachen University determined that early birds and night owls may have structural differences of their brains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t focus on switching your natural rhythms. Learn your natural tendencies by listening to what your body is telling you. Log the times that you get the most done and feel you have the best focus. If getting up early depletes your energy and your schedule allows the flexibility of starting your day later, then go with the flow. Take advantage of when your energy is at its best and schedule your most difficult tasks during those times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;6.&nbsp;Myth&nbsp;–&nbsp;Caffeine Makes You Productive&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a proven fact that caffeine increases your alertness and may help you focus. However, becoming reliant on a caffeine boost to increase your productivity might be a crutch worth kicking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, caffeine can affect your wellness in ways that can be detrimental to productivity. Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. In fact, it increases catecholamines, which trigger changes in our bodies that allow us to prepare for flight or fight responses. Catecholamines&nbsp;increase our heart rate, blood pressure and blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever consumed too much caffeine to keep you awake so you can study for a final or finish a big project and it left you with a sleepless night? The result – you’re too tired to perform at your best. Or have you ever stopped drinking caffeine for a few days and felt the pain of a headache resulting from withdrawal? Caffeine withdrawal can include other symptoms as well, such as lack of concentration, depression and muscle pain. These withdrawal symptoms can result in days of lost productivity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A great strategy for caffeine use is to limit it to the times you really need it, instead of making it a habit. And consider your caffeine source. Green tea is a great source because it also contains EGCG, which researchers believe can improve cognitive function. If you’re thinking about kicking your&nbsp;caffeine to the curb, there are many brain foods you can try to boost concentration. Blueberries, avocados, fatty fishes such as salmon, flax seeds, nuts and foods rich in B12 are good choices to boost energy and/or concentration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;7.&nbsp;Myth&nbsp;–&nbsp;Social Media is Killing Your Productivity&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_13546" style="width: 236px" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lightarrow.com/portfolio-item/pro-inbox-app"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-13546 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Pro.Inbox-App.png" alt="Pro.Inbox App" width="226" height="478" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pro.Inbox App&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Social Media &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; destroy your productivity. However, it depends on how you use it. Do you check social media several times a day? Do you spend endless hours looking at your friends’ photos on Instagram or Facebook? Do you read every article that pops up on Twitter? If this sounds familiar, you might rethink how you’re consuming social media information. Scheduling a few minutes each day on your calendar to check social media during breaks can actually be a great way to recharge. You just need to use an ounce of self discipline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Social media is valuable for finding information that you’re researching. It’s also valuable for keeping up with friends and business associates in one central location. For example, consider LinkedIn. Before LinkedIn, you might have spent endless hours collecting business cards and putting information into a Rolodex. Now, all your business contacts are found in one central location – just a few clicks away, which is an amazing productivity booster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Social media is incredible for locating and collecting information when researching any subject. There are several apps and applications that help you locate and curate this information. For example, our app&nbsp;&lt;a title="Pro.Inbox" href="http://lightarrow.com/portfolio-item/pro-inbox-app" target="_blank"&gt;Pro.Inbox&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is a great app for this use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Pro.Inbox, you can create information feeds from Twitter and Facebook and customize these feeds with keywords for any subject for which you’re interested. For example, imagine you’re focused on finding information about Clutter, CRM, Goals, GTD&nbsp;and other subjects. You can simply create feeds for all of these subjects and find all relevant information quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, you can convert the tweets or posts you discover to notes or calendar items to ensure that you have a record of an article or other information for your research. Converting posts and tweets to calendar items is an excellent time-saving method. When you&amp;#8217;re ready to follow up, you&amp;#8217;ll easily be able to find the saved information. And, in fact, if you schedule these items&nbsp;on your calendar, you certainly won&amp;#8217;t forget about them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;8.&nbsp;Myth&nbsp;–&nbsp;Socializing at the Office is a Waste of Time&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever got the stink eye from your boss when you were discussing important things at the office such as the latest episode of “Game of Thrones?” Many managers believe that socializing and laughing at the office is a huge time waster. In some cases, your boss is right;&nbsp;socializing can be a time suck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, with a little common sense, socializing can also build friendships, which can lead to better team relationships. When you have good relationships with co-workers, they’ll enjoy working with you. And perhaps, help you out when you need it. We spend 40 or more hours a week at our jobs. A happy worker is a productive worker. Go ahead, find some friends and laugh a little. Just properly manage your priorities and don&amp;#8217;t overdo it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your Turn&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;What common productivity myths would you like to bust?

      &lt;p&gt;Team LightArrow is excited about the new updates of LifeTopix 8.1, My.Agenda 3.1 and Pro.Inbox 1.1. Our new updates include several new features to maximize your productivity at home, at work and while you’re on the go. Some features are only applicable if you have the relevant in-app purchases. Keep reading to learn how you can take advantage of the latest exciting features.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Usability Enhancements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Quickly Open Items / Reduced Taps&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;With our most recent releases, the expanding cell was added in order to quickly allow you to access common functions for items. With this release, we introduced the “long press gesture” for&nbsp;opening items with fewer taps. For example, from your Agenda view, you can now tap and hold any item and it will open it immediately. If you prefer not to use the long touch, you can turn it on and off via a new setting in “My Settings,” – &amp;#8220;Toggle Actions for Tap and Long Press on Items.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Easy Reordering and Sorting of Checklists&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will notice a new icon in checklists that allows you to sort the checklist items alphabetically. This option has been broken out from the manual re-ordering of checklists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Easy Setting of Task Status&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In task lists, you can now tap directly on the task icon to set the status of tasks. You’re no longer required to open the item.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;New Swipe left to Right Gesture for Completed Tasks&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;For tasks that are in lists (such as in the Agenda view), you can swipe to the right to cross off a completed task to indicate that it&amp;#8217;s complete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Simplification of Sync and Backup Setup&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When setting up device-to-device sync, fewer steps are necessary and the online folder is selected for you, which simplifies the setup process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Non-intrusive Alerts for Rating and Backup Reminder&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The alerts for the rating reminder and backup reminder have been made less intrusive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New Light or Dark Theme&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You now have the option of white (instead of black) for the top bar and left navigational panel. Also, you can change the 12 Topics view to show a white background, instead of the various colors that normally display.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’ll see the new white top and left navigational controls shown throughout this post shown in the sample images. Below, view an example of the new 12 Topics view, as well as the settings that are now available (found in My Settings) for changing the colors from black to white and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12575 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/settings.png" alt="LightArrow My Settings Themes" width="651" height="682" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Calendar Enhancements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this latest update, your Agenda view is now combined with your Calendar views and all views have been greatly improved with the patent pending “time ribbon” as shown in the images below. In addition, the start of the week (Sunday/Monday) is now determined by your locale setting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Agenda View&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new merged Agenda View is shown below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12586 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/agendaview.png" alt="LightArrow Agenda View Best Calendar View" width="546" height="813" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Day View&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Day View, you are now able to tap and hold in an empty time slot to access the quick add panel and add a calendar item at the selected time. The redesigned&nbsp;Day View is shown below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12577 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/dayviewxcf.png" alt="LightArrow Day View" width="546" height="813" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Week View&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The redesigned&nbsp;Week View is shown below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12571 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/weekview.png" alt="LightArrow Week View" width="546" height="813" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Month View&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The redesigned&nbsp;Month View is shown below. When a date is selected, you can tap and hold on items listed for that date to move and drop them on a different day in the month view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12576 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/monthview.png" alt="LightArrow Month View" width="546" height="813" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Year View&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The redesigned&nbsp;Year View is shown below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12570 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/yearview.png" alt="LightArrow Year View" width="546" height="813" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Contexts View Enhancements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Contexts views have been enhanced to allow you to better follow the GTD&lt;strong&gt;®&lt;/strong&gt; method through the viewing of items tagged with multiple contexts. In addition, you’re now able to create your own &amp;#8220;Custom Topic Views&amp;#8221; by tagging items with context tags in order to group these items and view the associated items through tiles in the Contexts view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following image shows an example of the re-designed contexts view with tiles. Within this view, you can define contexts and colors, view all tagged items with your selected tags and access the Multiple Contexts view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12579 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/contexttags1.png" alt="LightArrow Context Tags" width="546" height="813" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new Multiple Contexts view allows you to view items associated with multiple contexts for items all at once. The filter shown in the following example allows you to select several different contexts at one time. All items tagged with one or more of these contexts will be returned in this view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12578 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/contexttags3.png" alt="LightArrow Multiple Contexts" width="546" height="813" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, the Multiple Contexts view enables you to sort your items that are tagged with contexts by type, date, last updated or by context as shown in the following image. This rich organization allows you to better organize and view your upcoming tasks, appointments and other items. In addition, it allows you to see what’s coming up next if you assign due dates to items, such as tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12581 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/contextstags2.png" alt="LightArrow Multiple Contexts" width="546" height="813" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are also able to override an item’s color with the context color if you wish. For example, you’ll see in the following example, all items with the context of “Exercise” items are flagged with a red context tag. The option in the My Settings view, “Override Item Color with Context” is set to ON. Because I’ve set this option to ON, all of the items that are tagged with Exercise are now red.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12580 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/contextstags4.png" alt="LightArrow Multiple Contexts" width="546" height="813" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Improved Colors for Drawings and Context Tags&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number of colors available for drawings and context tags is increased from 35 to 48, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12588 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/colors.png" alt="LightArrow Drawing and Handwriting" width="419" height="887" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Status Support for Projects, Assets and Contacts (with the Pro Contacts Pack)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Custom Project, Asset, and Contact Statuses are now available. You can create statuses by tapping the Project Statuses tile in the Tasks + Projects topic;&nbsp;the Asset Statuses tile in the Home + Assets topic; or the Contact Statuses tile in the People + Services topic. After you tap the appropriate tile, you tap the plus sign in the Project Statuses view,&nbsp;Asset Statuses view, or Contact Statuses view, which allows you to define a name for each status. A Hide/Show option is available, which allows you to hide projects, assets or contacts that are defined&nbsp;with the indicated status. For example, you could set a status of Bypassed and hide all the projects that are currently in the status of Bypassed. All&nbsp;types of status&nbsp;(Project, Asset or Contact) work the same way. The following shows an example of custom-defined project&nbsp;statuses and a project defined with a custom-defined status.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12598 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectstatus.png" alt="LightArrow Project Status" width="651" height="688" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Custom Task Status&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s now possible to set custom tasks statuses. The default task statuses include Not Started, In Progress, On Hold, Completed and Cancelled. If you wish to add new statuses, you define those new statuses and then map them to the default statuses. For example, your company might use statuses such as New, Planned, Waiting, Pending, etc. If so, you could map those statuses to the default status, and subsequently hide the default statuses, if you wish, as described below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can also hide tasks in certain statuses. For example, if you wish to hide all tasks that have a status of completed, you simply switch the Hide/Show switch to Hide. In the following example, the user wants to add a status “Waiting,” which is mapped to the status “On Hold.” To begin, the user goes to the Tasks + Projects topic and taps on Task Statuses as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12574 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/task1.png" alt="LightArrow Tasks + Projects" width="419" height="887" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, the user sees the default tasks&amp;#8217; statuses, which can be mapped as described. Tapping the plus sign accesses the New Task Status view, which allows the user to create a new status, by tapping the plus sign, such as “Waiting” as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12573 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/task2.png" alt="LightArrow Task Statuses" width="645" height="682" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this example, I’ve chosen to not hide the status, “On Hold,” but to also include the status, “Waiting.” Both statuses are available as shown below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12572 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tasks3.png" alt="LightArrow Tasks Status" width="419" height="887" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Optional Comment field in Bill Payments&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s been requested that an optional comment field be included for bill payments. This field is now available for your use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bulk Delete Support for Contacts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You now have the ability to delete several contacts at once. To initiate a bulk delete of contacts, go to the Contacts view by tapping the Contacts tile in the People + Services topic. Next, tap the icon indicated in the following graphic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12584 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/bulkdelete1.png" alt="LightArrow CRM Contacts Management" width="419" height="886" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After you tap the icon, select Bulk Delete as shown in the following image.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12583 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/bulkdelete2.png" alt="LightArrow CRM Contacts Management" width="419" height="887" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Contacts view displays your contacts in a list. When this list appears, tap all the contacts you wish to delete and each one will be checked. After you’ve completed your selections, tap Bulk Delete to remove the contacts. The following image shows an example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12582 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/bulkdelete3.png" alt="LightArrow Bulk Delete of Contacts" width="419" height="887" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Asset Total Values by Group&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When viewing total assets by group, you can now view the total cost and value, as shown in the following example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12585 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/assets.png" alt="LightArrow Asset Management" width="419" height="887" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Enhanced Printing, Sharing and Email Support for Agenda, Assets and Contacts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When viewing your agenda, a&nbsp;group of assets, a group of contacts and the detail for a contact, you can print this information to a PDF and save this PDF file&nbsp;for the purposes of sharing, saving or printing. For example,&nbsp;if you want to print an agenda for a group of people, you can save the agenda to PDF and share it with the group by emailing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To print, begin&nbsp;by going to the view you wish to print (your&nbsp;agenda, a&nbsp;group of assets, a group of contacts, or&nbsp;the detail for a contact). Tap the icon in the upper right and then choose Print. Next, choose whether you wish to print in Portrait or Landscape view. The Agenda View is shown in the following example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12589 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/print1.png" alt="LightArrow Agenda Printing" width="651" height="684" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, choose whether or not you would like to save a local file of this document.&nbsp;You can locate this file by going to the Notes + Files, Lists topic and tapping Folders. You&amp;#8217;ll find a folder named My Documents. The saved&nbsp;file is stored in the My Documents folder and is indicated by the name and date. You can share/print this report (or save it to an online file service) by choosing the icon indicated in (4) below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12590 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/print2.png" alt="LightArrow Reporting" width="651" height="686" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Default&nbsp;Locker Field for New Lockers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Lockers that you create over and over again, you can now create &amp;#8220;Default Locker Items.&amp;#8221; For example, perhaps you store several personal identification numbers (PIN codes). With this feature, you can set up a Default Locker Item&nbsp;called&nbsp;&amp;#8220;PIN,&amp;#8221;&nbsp;eliminating the need to&nbsp;enter the same information repeatedly. To take advantage of this feature, go to the Bookmarks + Lockers topic and tap the Default Locker items tile. After entering your PIN, tap New Locker Item (1). Next, enter the Field&nbsp;name and Value to indicate the default name and value. The Field name is required and the Value&nbsp;is optional. After you complete this procedure,&nbsp;tap the Lockers tile and tap the plus sign to create a new Locker. In the New Locker view, add the Title and Description, and then tap Add Default Items (2). You&amp;#8217;ll see the Default Locker Item that you created. Select it, tap Create, and tap the new Locker Item to make any modifications (3). The following image shows an example of the views that are described above.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12593 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lockers.png" alt="Lightarrow Private Data" width="651" height="459" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Manual&nbsp;Ordering of Undated Tasks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When viewing Undated&nbsp;tasks, you can now reorder the tasks with a &amp;#8220;touch to reorder&amp;#8221; gesture. When viewing Undated tasks, tap &amp;#8220;Tap to reorder.&amp;#8221; Three lines appear next to each task. Tap and hold the three lines and move the tasks up and down as necessary to re-order them. The following image shows an example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12595 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/itaskreorder.png" alt="Lightarrow Task Management" width="419" height="887" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Editable Titles&nbsp;for Photos, Drawings, and Video&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is now possible to edit the titles of photos, drawings and video files. Simply edit one of these items and modify the name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Repeat Schedules for Events&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previously, Appointments, Tasks and Payments supported repeat schedules and now we&amp;#8217;ve introduced the ability to use&nbsp;repeat schedules in events. This feature works the same as it does for Appointments, Tasks and Appointments. You can find more information about how to configure repeat schedules in your &lt;a title="Repeat Schedules" href="http://lightarrow.com/support/productivity-portal/help/repeat-schedules"&gt;Repeat Schedules online help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Online Task Integration Improvements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve included improvements and more flexibility when using online tasks from&nbsp;Google, Toodledo and Asana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Create iOS Calendar Item for Online Tasks&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new setting is available in My Settings, &amp;#8220;Create iOS Calendar Item for Online Tasks,&amp;#8221; which allows you to choose whether or not to create&nbsp;an iOS calendar item for your online tasks that are synced in your LightArrow app with&nbsp;Google, Toodledo and Asana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Choice of Deleting Corresponding Online Task&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you delete an online task that is synced with&nbsp;Google, Toodledo and Asana, you can choose whether or not to delete the corresponding online task, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12602 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/OnlineTask1.png" alt="LightArrow Delete Local Only" width="546" height="813" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Unlink Online Tasks&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;You now have the ability to unlink a task synced with an online task (such as Asana, Google or Toodledo). When you unlink a task by choosing Actions -&amp;gt; Unlink from the task, the task becomes a local LightArrow app task.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12603 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/unlinktask.png" alt="LightArrow Unlink Google Tasks" width="419" height="887" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pro Contacts Pack Enhancements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve introduced several new features, which are available via&nbsp;the Pro Contacts Pack, as described below. In addition to the features below, a configurable status for contacts is included, which is described earlier in this post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Auto-complete for Custom Fields if Previous Answers Exist&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;If previous answers exist in custom fields that you&amp;#8217;ve designed for contacts in the People + Services topic, auto-complete is now available for custom fields for&nbsp;contacts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Forms Applicability by Group and Status&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Custom forms can now be applied according to group and/or status as shown below in the following example. To take advantage of this feature, tap the Custom Log Forms tile in the People + Services topic. Next, tap&nbsp;any of your custom log forms. In the Contact Log Form view, tap Applicable Statuses and/or Applicable Groups, then check the statuses or groups you wish to include, and then tap Save.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12608 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/applicablegroups.png" alt="LightArrow Contact Groups" width="645" height="680" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Custom Filters&nbsp;(Reporting) in&nbsp;the Contacts View&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Contacts view now includes the ability to create custom filters for your contacts, and to subsequently print a report of your contacts that meet the criteria that you defined via your custom filters. For example, imagine you&amp;#8217;re a personal trainer and you&amp;#8217;re keeping track of the Body Mass Index (BMI) of your clients. You can create a custom filter that identifies those with a BMI above or below a threshold that you&amp;#8217;ve decided upon. An example of this scenario is shown in the following images.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To take advantage of this feature, go to the Contacts view in the People + Services topic. Next, tap Filter By. To create a new filter, tap New Filter. After entering a title and optional comment, tap New Criteria. Select an attribute from the choices that are provided (which include your custom statuses and log forms). Next, enter an operator, such as Equal, Contains, etc. Finally, enter a value you wish for the items to equal. Below, Image 1 shows an example of the available attributes and Image 2 shows a completed filter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12609 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NewFilter.png" alt="LightArrow Contact Filters" width="645" height="683" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The images below show an example of a filtered search and the printable report, which can also be exported to a CSV file for use in your favorite spreadsheet application.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12610 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/contactsreport.png" alt="LightArrow Contacts Report" width="645" height="681" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pro Inbox Pack Enhancements&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following enhancements apply to the Pro Inbox pack available in the apps that include this optional pack, such as My.Agenda and LifeTopix. These enhancements are standard with the Pro.Inbox app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;IMAP 4 and Limited Exchange* Support&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="im"&gt;For those using IMAP 4 (Internet Message Access Protocol) and Exchange (Outlook) for email can now enjoy the features for converting email messages to a rich variety of data types and calendar items, such as tasks, appointments, events and more.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;*Exchange support has only been tested for &lt;a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/hosted-email-for-business-exchange-online-FX103739072.aspx"&gt;Exchange&nbsp;Online hosted by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. Supported configuration includes IMAP4 for “Exchange Online” with SSL/TLS option. We currently do not support some typical corporate Exchange environments, such as the Microsoft NTLM authentication and others. This is due to the limitations of the underlying 3rd party technology we use in our Apps. We are working on making our support of Exchange broader over future updates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Email Preview&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new &amp;#8220;Email Preview&amp;#8221; is available and many functions are available from its view. From the icons shown below the new email preview (refer to the following image), users can now access common actions such as Reply, Reply All, Forward, Follow-up, Flag, Mark as Unread, Delete, Convert to Any Type, Create as Note and Associate, Add to Existing Note, Create as Evernote Note, Create as Toodledo Note, Convert Sender to Contact, Add Sender to Group, Convert Everyone to Contacts, Add Everyone to Group, Smart Convert, and Select a Target (online and local folders).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12710 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/July_8_1.png" alt="LightArrow Email Client" width="419" height="887" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Evernote Custom Feeds with Search and Convert Actions&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is now even easier to work with Evernote. We’ve added the ability to create Evernote feeds, which enables you to access your Evernote notes in a list view. Once you access notes, you can convert the notes to tasks, projects, products, appointments, hosting events, attending events, notes, checklists, trips, visitors, and inbox items. Once these items are converted, you can associate them with LightArrow app objects and schedule the items&nbsp;on your calendar, which works seamlessly with your iOS calendar and all the calendars that your iOS device supports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, as shown below you can (1) choose Evernote from among your email, web and social feeds; (2) convert a note from a variety of types (including checklists); (3) choose a type of object to convert to; and (4) create an object (e.g. checklist), which can be published&nbsp;on your calendar and agenda (automatically).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12346 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Evernote-Feeds.png" alt="LightArrow Evernote Feeds" width="600" height="893" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you would expect from any excellent personal assistant or organizer, the items that you convert or access through&nbsp;the Notes + Files, Lists topic automatically appear on your calendar (if you wish), as shown below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12349" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/calendar-688x1024.png" alt="LightArrow Agenda View" width="600" height="893" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;OAuth Support for Gmail (Two-step Authentication)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previously, email accounts that were set up with &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/landing/2step/" target="_blank"&gt;two-step verification&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a title="OAuth" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth" target="_blank"&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt;) were not supported by LightArrow apps. Now you can take advantage of the extra security that these accounts offer and enjoy the convenience and productivity boosting features of LightArrow apps (LifeTopix, My.Agenda or Pro.Inbox) if you&amp;#8217;re using two-step verification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Improved Search for Email Feeds and Evernote Notes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Searching for text within email body and email subject has been made faster and more accurate with improved technologies. In addition, LightArrow apps now support Evernote feeds and support Evernote server-side search, which uses a powerful Evernote grammar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Act on Emails from a Contact (View from Contact Detail similar to Twitter and Facebook)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is now possible to view email messages from a contact for all email accounts that you’ve given your LightArrow app access to – from one place. For example, if you set up an email address for a contact in the People + Services topic, you can simply locate a contact, add their email address (if you haven’t done so already), and simply tap Email tile -&amp;gt; View Emails to see all emails for all of your accounts from this person. Once you’ve accessed the email, you can act on these emails by converting them to the data types shown in the image below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12709 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/July8_demo1.png" alt="LightArrow Email Client" width="645" height="1359" /&gt;Follow Up (Create Quick Inbox Item with due date) for Emails, Tweets and Facebook items&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Users can now immediately set a follow-up as a Quick Inbox item with a due date for email messages, Tweets and Facebook items. For example, you can simply select the Follow-up option for Email Messages, Tweets and Facebook items as shown in the example below.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12713 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/followup.png" alt="LightArrow Email Client" width="645" height="684" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Flag/Unflag Support for Email Items&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is now possible to flag and unflag email messages to help you remember to follow up on flagged email messages at a later time. Users can simply choose the flag option from an Email Feed in their LightArrow app as shown in the image below. &lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12714 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/flagging.png" alt="LightArrow Email Client" width="419" height="887" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Multiple Senders and Multiple Email Support in Email Feed Rule Configuration&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;LightArrow apps now support a unified email inbox. Not only can you process your social media messaging (Facebook and Twitter), you can also process and view all your emails (IMAP, iCloud, Gmail, Outlook, AOL, Yahoo, etc.) centrally within one view. Furthermore, you can filter the email by multiple senders if you wish by entering their email addresses in the Senders box as shown below. When configuring an email feed, simply check the email accounts you wish to use; optionally enter any senders you wish to include; optionally enter any search terms; enter the number of days you wish to go back in time; and choose whether or not to view read email. The configuration is simple and shown below.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12715 size-full" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ALLEMAIL.png" alt="LightArrow Unified Inbox" width="546" height="813" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Converted Items in Contacts (Tasks, Appointments, Notes Etc.) Are Automatically Associated with the Currently-viewed Contact&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, when users convert Tweets, Facebook posts or email messages within a contact (in the Contact detail from the Social or Emails tile) to items such as tasks, appointments, notes, etc., the Lightarrow app automatically associates that data with the contact that you&amp;#8217;re currently viewing. To take advantage of this feature, tap the tile that&amp;#8217;s highlighted below (or the Email tile); convert an item to an actionable item; and subsequently view it from the associated items. In the following example, a tweet was converted to a task.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AutomaticallyAssociated.png"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12724" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AutomaticallyAssociated.png" alt="LightArrow Contacts Associate Tweets" width="419" height="887" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Over the years, probably brought on by being a startup junkie and always having poured myself unreservedly&nbsp;into work my entire professional life, I&amp;#8217;ve developed several bad habits&nbsp;or things&nbsp;that are harmful&nbsp;to health, and perhaps also to relationships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, there is this insatiable passion and seemingly endless energy to take on challenges, get stuff done, being an engine that is always on. Sadly, on the other hand, there is fatigue, irritability, loss of focus, and low quality sleep. Undeniably, according to both ancient wisdom and modern medical know-how, the latter set of things&nbsp;affect one&amp;#8217;s health dangerously. And with equal&nbsp;importance, the closest relationships are exposed to&nbsp;occasional bouts of irritability and other forms of&nbsp;negative&nbsp;energy. Broadly speaking, there is a general feeling of stress and anxiety as a result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three things I have either changed or started recently are personally helping me a lot without taking away from my productivity, and seem to be helping cut out&nbsp;the bad set of things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-12618 size-large" src="http://lightarrow.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/RelaxPool-759x1030.jpg" alt="RelaxPool" width="759" height="1030" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Turn off all audible alerts and lock-screen notifications&nbsp;on devices. (Except calendar reminders and text&nbsp;messages.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was a surprisingly welcome change. Sounds simple, but do you really need to be suddenly interrupted from your flow or zone, with a ding and a lock screen message that &amp;#8220;Your Facebook friend so-and-so just joined Pinterest.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; and other irrelevant, unnecessary crap? I started going into my iPhone&amp;#8217;s Notifications setup&nbsp;each time anything came up (Mail app alerts, Google alerts, Facebook, Twitter, CNBC alerts, and perhaps 10 others), and turning them off. I left Calendar and text message alerts on as I control the reminders I put on my calendar items, and also I am not a defocussed incessant texter &amp;#8211;&nbsp;especially when I work, so most texts I get are important. On the same note, during&nbsp;work hours, I only make myself visible to the group of people I am working with on messaging apps. I still check my email and look at my agenda frequently, but on my own schedule, when I am in-between focussed tasks &amp;#8211; kind of like waking up in sync with natural sleep cycles. Which leads me to my second thing &amp;#8211; sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Sleep well. Instead of an alarm clock, use an app like &lt;a href="http://www.sleepcycle.com" target="_blank"&gt;Sleep Cycle.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started using this about a couple of months ago instead of using a regular alarm. It is ingeniously simple. You turn it on, put it next to your pillow facing down. It tracks your sleep cycles, duration and quality by tracking motion (whatever it detects from your tossing and turning, etc.), and perhaps from movement noise since it asks for access to the microphone. You can configure a window of time to wake up in, and it detects a stage when you are either awake or your sleep is in the waking part of the cycle during that time window, and wakes you up. Also, it measures your sleep quality and gives you a score and a graph of sleep level over time &amp;#8211; that way you can correlate various pre-sleep activities with quality of sleep &amp;#8211; for example, does sipping some tart cherry juice an hour before going to bed actually help with sleep, does deep breathing right before sleep give you some golden deep sleep cycles, etc. As my friend Chip had said 20 years ago: you should&nbsp;measure things&nbsp;that you care about. Inducing positive energy and a calm disengagement via&nbsp;pre-sleep deep breathing, and cutting out sources of negative energy seem to help in my case &amp;#8211; which takes me to the third point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Add positive energy (many choices). Cut out negative energy (namely TV news channels, and social media complainers).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Points 1 and 2 take zero time investment and give heavy positive returns. So that&amp;#8217;s golden for the&nbsp;ROI (return-on-investment) fanatics. Point three is also a net positive &amp;#8211; consuming&nbsp;about 30-60 minutes of time every day for adding positive energy (meditation / deep-breathing / quiet-time / simple yoga / reading / praying / reflecting / being grateful &amp;#8211; look up &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology" target="_blank"&gt;Positive Psychology&lt;/a&gt; when you have a minute), but freeing up much more than that by subtracting sources of negative energy that steal time both directly and indirectly, and negatively affect every aspect of life. I am talking primarily about TV &amp;#8220;news&amp;#8221; folk, political talking-heads and other assorted villains &amp;#8211; kings and queens of ignorance on TV and the internet constantly&nbsp;furthering&nbsp;their narrow agendas by stepping on your gentle minds. They come from the right and the left &amp;#8211; ignore them, and instead look straight at what you value &amp;#8211; there&amp;#8217;s much better stuff there. The negative energy sources&nbsp;are plentiful in our social circles, in person, and more so on social media since it&amp;#8217;s a much larger set. Cut. Them. Out. Hide them from your feeds, unfollow them, walk-away, change the topic, do whatever it takes to cleanly&nbsp;disengage. There are always tons of&nbsp;important things that require immense energy, constructive debate, championing&nbsp;ideas, defending values, and much effort&nbsp;without all the shallow and shrill things&nbsp;stealing our precious time. Any issue that is important to you can be engaged with constructively without subscribing to a buffet-line of fast-food class&nbsp;negative sentiments.&nbsp;That frees up more time to&nbsp;embrace&nbsp;positive things. Things you admire. Things you learn from. Things that leave you positive. Spend time with people that enrich you, and take a vacation every now and then!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What are some of your favorite positive energy sources? What kinds of negative energy sources have you successfully cut out? Please share.&lt;/p&gt;
