       <p><em>“Recent research by McKinsey and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology shows that companies that inject big data and analytics into their operations outperform their peers by 5% in productivity and 6% in profitability. Our experience suggests that for retail and CPG companies, the upside is at least as great, if not greater.”</em></p> 
       <p><strong>Peter Breuer, director of&nbsp;McKinsey &amp; Co.’s retail practice in Germany</strong></p> 
       <p>With November half over and 2015 starting to peek at us over the horizon, we decided it was time to take a look at a few examples of what retailers have been using big data for in 2014. Here are three examples of use cases for Big Data in retail that have emerged in the last year, followed by a few InfoTrellis predictions about what will happen next in the new year when it comes to the evolution of how companies are implementing their Big Data strategies.</p> 
       <p style="text-align:center;"> </p>
       <h2 style="text-align:center;">Macy’s</h2> 
       <p style="text-align:center;">Personalized Marketing</p> 
       <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>The main goal for Macy’s CEO, Terry Lundgren, is to offer more localized, personalized and smarter retail customer experience across all channels. They use Big Data among others to create customer-centric assortments. They analyse a large amount of different data points, such as out-of-stock rates, price promotions, sell-through rates etc. and combine these with SKU data from a product at a certain location and time as well as customer data in order to optimize their local assortments to the individual customer segments in those locations.</em></span></p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>&nbsp;In addition to that, Macy’s gathers, and of course analyses, a vast amount of customer data ranging from visit frequencies and sales to style preferences and online &amp; offline personal motivations. They use this data to create a personalized customer experience including customized incentives at checkouts. Even more, they are now capable of sending hyper-targeted direct mailings to their customers, including 500,000 unique versions of a single mailing.</em> <em>The results are compelling; Macy’s e-commerce division alone has witnessed a growth of over 10% and an overall annual revenue growth of 4% with the use of Big Data Analytics.</em></span></p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;">(<a style="color:#339966;" href="http://www.bigdata-startups.com/BigData-startup/macys-changing-shopping-experience-big-data-analytics/">Macy’s Is Changing The Shopping Experience With Big Data Analytics</a>)</span></p> 
       <p>Personalizing the user experience is a ubiquitous use case for big data, so it’s exciting to see a retailer actually implementing the technology to accomplish and prove out the value of this marketing strategy. Four percent growth is nothing to scoff at; this number represents millions of dollars on pure profit they didn’t have before. For companies that still believe they can accurately segment their hundreds of thousands of customers with fewer than a hundred profile archetypes, this is an undeniable piece of proof that they may need to consider getting on the bandwagon if they don’t want those millions of dollars to be coming out of their share of the customer’s spending habits.</p> 
       <p>What’s more, this is a front-and-center application of big data that is highly visible to the shopper. Whether or not they can articulate the difference in quality of experience they get from a retailer that uses it and a retailer that doesn’t, it’s a difference they can intuitively <em>feel</em> and will definitely react to by rewarding one store with loyalty over the others.</p> 
       <p>Once companies start pulling social data and combining it with internal customer data, their targeting and micro-segmentation capabilities will enable even more uniquely tailored marketing and customer experiences. So long as companies remember that the purpose of this data-collection is to minimize friction and irrelevant messaging for their customers and never to manipulate them or milk them for money like a mindless herd, the consumer stands only to benefit from the evolution of this practice.</p> 
       <p>For this reason, my prediction is that this will be a big differentiator in the coming years as the companies that experiment with it first (i.e. the early adopters) get better and better, making the gap increasingly noticeable to the end consumer. There will be a scramble by the companies that lagged behind to try to catch up, and this will represent a big shift for the retail industry’s established best practices in much the same way the idea of the loyalty program and the digital storefront did.</p> 
       <h2 style="text-align:center;">LUSH</h2> 
       <p style="text-align:center;">Supply Chain Efficiencies</p> 
       <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>LUSH Fresh Handmade Cosmetics used big data technology in 2014 to drive in-store profitability and deliver savings of over £1 million in stock loss. Working with many datasets – retail data within EPOS systems, supply chain and stock management, payroll and timesheet systems for staff management – LUSH sought and implemented a technology platform that could be used by employees at every level throughout the business to provide access to relevant sales, stock, store and staff information to improve performance.</em></span></p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>&nbsp;The BI tool is deployed across the entire LUSH organisation. The retail accounts team uses their new platform to dig into the numbers behind the sales in each shop, to keep an eye on ledgers, petty cash and every other aspect of running the business financially. </em></span></p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>The technology is used in all the stores, so all the shop managers and employees on the shopfloor have access to updates every hour. The big data technology is also used in LUSH’s manufacturing department for stock management, allowing the team to facilitate orders between the factory and the shops and can keep an eye on stock position around the country. The gathering and analysis of big data has also helped LUSH to get a view of its sales and stock which has led to improvements in forecasting and sourcing of key ingredients from suppliers. </em></span></p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;">(<a style="color:#339966;" href="http://www.information-age.com/it-management/strategy-and-innovation/123457865/lush-fresh-handmade-cosmetics-saves-%C2%A31-million-user-driven-bi">LUSH Fresh Handmade Cosmetics saves £1 million with user-driven BI</a>)</span></p> 
       <p>Big Data doesn’t just have to mean customer-obsessed data like social media or purchase data, and LUSH has demonstrated excellently how better managing and understanding the “big data” generated by business processes can lead to the increased efficiencies that save companies real money. The above quote doesn’t go into a great amount of detail about this, but LUSH is also apparently giving their in-store staff the power to make decisions about the physical customer experience around displays and promotions using insights gained from this data.</p> 
       <p>The big advantage here is the immediacy of the data and the accessibility of it across the organization. Giving employees in the store both the ability and the direction needed to make swift data-driven changes means a real-time responsiveness that is key to taking advantage of interesting correlations like how <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/big-data/big-data-analytics/big-data-reveals-weather-related-shopping-patterns/d/d-id/1110392?">shopping behavior changes during certain weather</a> or changing a marketing strategy on the fly when regional tweaks have the ability to boost sales.</p> 
       <p>The more data they have and the closer they get to real-time, automated analysis, the better companies like LUSH get at managing their backend operations. This isn’t something that the customer will see as clearly as a customized marketing experience, but when a store always magically has the kinds of things they’re hoping to buy and then a few other things they didn’t realize they wanted until they laid eyes on them, repeat visits are likely just for the convenience of the inventory. Customers don’t much care about whether a store loses money on excess, unwanted inventory, but they’re unknowingly benefiting just as much as the company is when predictive analytics can prevent that unfortunate occurrence.</p> 
       <p>Going forward, these kinds of clever algorithms stand to get better and better as companies pull in data from outside of their company, using social media to understand demand and competition as well as more granular breakdowns by region and even individual store location. I don’t anticipate the rush to get in on this use of Big Data technology will quite as dramatic as need to invest in its marketing applications over the next few years, but it’s a tangible, valuable use-case that will apply to the more pragmatic of executives. We will likely see slow but steady growth in the number of companies that decide to implement Big Data technology with the goal of improving their BI behind the scenes.</p> 
       <h2 style="text-align:center;">Starbucks</h2> 
       <p style="text-align:center;">Maximized Profitability of Store Locations</p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>Understanding the pools of information pouring into the databases of Starbucks has become a major focus at the international brew chain, even though its high-profile CEO doesn’t much care for it. “Howard [Schultz] doesn’t care about data. He has absolutely no head for data,” said Joe LaCugna, director of analytics and business intelligence at Starbucks during a session at the Big Data Retail Forum in Chicago.</em></span></p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>&nbsp;A full quarter of Starbucks transactions are made via its popular loyalty cards, and that results in “huge amounts” of data, Mr. LaCugna said, but company isn’t sure what to do with it all yet. The same goes for social media data, he said. Starbucks has a team who analyzes social data, but, “We haven’t figured out what exactly to do with it yet,” he said. It’s a common refrain among brands, and many of the speakers and attendees here at the conference.</em></span></p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;">&nbsp;(<a style="color:#339966;" href="http://adage.com/article/datadriven-marketing/starbucks-data-pours/240502/">At Starbucks, Data Pours In. But What to Do With It?</a> – Published in 2013)</span></p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>In 2007 and 2008, Starbucks’ CEO Howard Schultz was forced to come out of retirement to close hundreds of stores, and rethink the company’s strategic growth plan. This time around, Starbucks took a more disciplined, data-driven approach to store openings and used mapping software to easily analyze massive amounts of data about planned store openings. </em></span></p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>The software analyzed location-based data and demographics to determine the best place to open Starbucks stores without hurting sales at other Starbucks locations. The software is also helping to determine where the next 1,500-plus stores should be placed not only to help the company expand, but drive revenue for new store developments.</em></span></p> 
       <p><span style="color:#339966;">&nbsp;(<a style="color:#339966;" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/barbarathau/2014/04/24/how-big-data-helps-retailers-like-starbucks-pick-store-locations-an-unsung-key-to-retail-success/2/">How Big Data Helps Chains Like Starbucks Pick Store Locations — An (Unsung) Key To Retail Success</a> – Published in 2014)</span></p> 
       <p>Starbucks is an interesting case because it’s collecting all the right data to be implementing something like Macy’s is doing, but doesn’t seem particularly motivated to try it just yet. Indeed, a year ago they admitted they didn’t have a clear strategy for using the data generated by their loyalty program.</p> 
       <p>This year, they’ve put forward a clear case that benefits them in an area that is very important to the franchise; store location. For retailers, this has always been an absolutely essential part of decision-making when it comes to growing their profits and customer base year over year. It makes sense that Starbucks, having lost so much money with bad calls on store locations in the past, would choose to use their data for determining where they can gain the most long-term growth and profit when planning new locations.</p> 
       <p>This is a great example of uses for Big Data that aren’t as intuitive as customer experience related ones. It speaks to the kinds of use cases that speak to CEOs like Schultz – nothing fancy or weird, just better quality and higher quantifies of information being used to answer a question they would have been asking anyways as part of their overall strategy. It goes to show how powerful Big Data can be when you use it to approach an established goal from a new direction.</p> 
       <p>It does, however, raise a few eyebrows. Starbucks is considered an industry leader in many regards, but the reluctance to use their glut of data for more than just location planning could be a serious miscalculation by the chain. My prediction is that one of their competitors will figure it out sooner than they do and offer a data-driven, social-media-integrated loyalty program that tailors its messaging and rewards at a clearly higher level of sophistication, and when this happens Starbucks will either swiftly release an imitation or else find themselves with a significantly reduced grip on their core market.</p> 
       <p>Still, that’s not to say that it’s a bad idea to be using their data in the way they are now, and I expect other retailers will adopt the methodology in 2015 – many of them already are.</p> 
       <h2 style="text-align:center;">What to Expect in 2015</h2> 
       <p><em>We found that 62 percent of retailers report that the use of information (including big data) and analytics is creating a competitive advantage for their organizations, compared with 63 percent of cross-industry respondents. </em></p> 
       <p><em>To compete in a consumer-empowered economy, it is increasingly clear that retailers must leverage their information assets to gain a comprehensive understanding of markets, customers, products, distribution locations, competitors, employees and more. In this industry deep dive, we examine industry-specific challenges, as well as provide our top-level recommendations for retail organizations.</em></p> 
       <p><strong>IBM</strong></p> 
       <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
       <p>The number of retailers initiating Big Data projects in 2014 <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2848718">jumped sharply</a> from the number in 2013. The adoption rates are increasing steadily and the industry is soon to reach a tipping point and the arms-race will begin.</p> 
       <p>Although there has been plenty of hype around Big Data this year, the explosion of in-earnest technology implementations has yet to begin. 2015 looks like it will either be the beginning of this tipping point or will be the year where one or two huge successes will hit the news and initiate the rush to follow suit.</p> 
       <p>Core to these major successes will be the ability to source both internal and external data for these analytics. The next-best-offer that can build on data about you from your Twitter and Facebook profile, sharpening its understanding of your wants and needs, will have a clear advantage over algorithms that only use past purchase data. The loyalty program that understands what kind of incentives motivate you using the same kind of connected information across multiple platforms will similarly benefit.</p> 
       <p>We expect to see early adopters achieve great success with leveraging the in depth understanding gained from social media – to target their customers or loyalty program members as individuals. We also expect that the results (and market share gain) of those early adopters will kickstart similar projects within a larger number of retailers.</p> 
       <p>We also anticipate an increasing number of implementations of new micro-segmentation models. Retailers using classic segmentation approaches (for example, one classic model uses just 66 segments and only updates their characteristics once per year) will start considering big data enabled dynamic segmentation models with larger number of segments, where the segments are updated potentially weekly – to better reflect the dynamic nature of today competitive environment</p> 
       <p>All in all, 2015 looks like it will be a very exciting time for retailers.</p>

       <div class="post-info"> 
        <p> <span class="time">November 10, 2014</span> <span class="author">by <a href="http://blog.infotrellis.com/author/jandps/" title="Posts by Jan D. Svensson" rel="author">Jan D.

       </div> 
       <p>I often become involved in an organization’s MDM program when they’ve reached out to InfoTrellis for help with cleaning up after a failed project or initiating attempt number X at achieving what, to some, is a real struggle. There can be a lot of reasons for a Master Data Management implementation failing, and none of them are due to the litany of blame game reasons that can be used in these scenarios.&nbsp; Most failures arise from common problems that people just were not prepared for.</p> 
       <p>Let’s examine some of the top reasons MDM implementations fail. In the end they probably won’t surprise you, but if you haven’t experienced it yet you will be better prepared to face them if they happen.</p> 
       <h2>Underestimating the work</h2> 
       <p>I am starting with this one because it leads to many of the others, and is a complex topic. It seems like a simple thing to estimate the work but there are a lot of aspects to an MDM project that aren’t obvious that can severely impact timelines and your success.</p> 
       <h3 style="text-align:center;">“It’s just a project like any other”</h3> 
       <p>Let me start by saying MDM is not a project, it’s a journey, or at the very least a program.</p> 
       <p>Most organizations thinking about implementing MDM are large to global companies. Even medium sized companies that started small and experience growth over time have the same problems as their global sized piers.&nbsp; While the size of the chaos in a global company may seem much larger, they also have far more resources to throw at the problem than their smaller brethren.</p> 
       <p>If we stick to the MDM party domain as a point of reference (most organizations start here with MDM), the number of sources or points of contact with party information can be staggering. You may have systems that:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Manage the selling of products or services to customers</li> 
        <li>Manage vendors you deal with or contract to</li> 
        <li>Extract data to data warehouse for customer analytics and vendor performance</li> 
        <li>HR systems to manage employees who may also be customers</li> 
        <li>Self-service customer portals</li> 
        <li>Marketing campaign management systems</li> 
        <li>Customer notification systems</li> 
        <li>Many others</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>A lot of large organizations will have all of these systems, each having multiple applications, and often multiple systems responsible for the same business function. So by now you are probably saying, yes I know this, and…?&nbsp; Well your MDM “project” will need to sit in the middle of all of this, and in many cases since many of these systems will be legacy mainframe based systems, you will need to be transparent as these systems won’t be allowed to be changed.</p> 
       <p>MDM can be on the scale of many of the transformation programmes your organization may be undertaking to replace aging legacy systems and moving to modern distributed Service Oriented Architecture based solutions.</p> 
       <h3>Big Bang Never Works</h3> 
       <p>Now that we have seen the potential size of your MDM problem, let me just remind you that you can’t do it all at once. Sure you can plan your massive transformation programme and execute it – but if you have ever really done one of these, you know it’s a lot harder than it seems and that the outcome is usually not as satisfying as you expected it to be.&nbsp; You end up cutting corners, blowing the budget, missing the timelines, and de-scoping the work just trying to deliver.</p> 
       <p>What is one of the typical reasons this happens on your MDM transformation project?</p> 
       <h3>You Don’t Know What You Don’t Know</h3> 
       <p>You have all these systems you are going to integrate with and in many cases you are going to need to be transparent in that those systems may not know they are going to be interacting with your new MDM solution. You are going to need to know things like:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>What data do they use? 
         <ul> 
          <li>How often?</li> 
          <li>How much?</li> 
          <li>When?</li> 
         </ul> </li> 
        <li>Do they update the data? 
         <ul> 
          <li>How often?</li> 
          <li>How?</li> 
          <li>What?</li> 
         </ul> </li> 
        <li>Do they need to know about changes made by others? 
         <ul> 
          <li>How often is the change notice required?</li> 
          <li>Do they need to know it’s changed, or what the change was?</li> 
         </ul> </li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>This type of information seems pretty straight forward. I haven’t told you anything you probably didn’t know, but, when you go to ask these questions, the answer you will mostly likely often get is:</p> 
       <p style="text-align:center;">“I don’t know.”</p> 
       <p>Ok, so the documentation isn’t quite up to date, (I am being kind), but you are just going to go out and find the answer. Which leads to the next problem.</p> 
       <h3>Not Enough Resources</h3> 
       <p>So this is an easy problem to solve. I’ll hire some more business analysts, get some more developers to look at the code, get some more project managers to keep them on track.&nbsp; Seems like a plan, and on the surface it looks like the obvious answer, (ignoring how hard it is to locate available quality IT people these days), but these aren’t the resources that are the problem.</p> 
       <p style="text-align:center;">You don’t have enough SMEs.</p> 
       <p>The BA’s, developers and others are all going to need time from your <strong>subject matter experts</strong>.&nbsp; The subject matter experts are already busy<strong> because </strong>they are subject matter experts.&nbsp; There typically aren’t enough of them to go around, and if you have a lot of systems to deal with, you are facing a lot of IT and business SME’s.</p> 
       <p>What your SMEs bring to the table is intellectual property. Intellectual property is critical to the success of your implementation.&nbsp; You will need the knowledge your SMEs bring on your various systems, but there is another kind of intellectual property that you are going to need and can be tied to a very lengthy process.</p> 
       <h3>Data Management through Governance</h3> 
       <p>In order to be able to master your information, you will need to amalgamate data from multiple sources and both the meaning and the use of that information will need to be clearly defined. What may appear to be the same information from one source may have a different meaning.&nbsp; Data governance is a key requirement to be able to establish the enterprise data definitions that are crucial for your master data.&nbsp; Even in mature environments this can be a challenging task and can consume significant time and resources.</p> 
       <p>Data governance may seem like a problematic and time consuming exercise but it is an effective tool to use against one of the other major hurdles you will face in trying to establish a common set of master data.</p> 
       <h2>That’s My Data</h2> 
       <p>Many organizations are organized into silos. The silos are designed to look after their own interests, funded to maintain their business goals and competitive for resources and funding.&nbsp; While the end goal of any organization is the success of the organization, <strong>the silo measures its success in terms of itself</strong>.</p> 
       <p>An MDM implementation is by nature at odds with the silo based organization as master data is data that is of value to a cross section of the business and thus spans silos. The danger in many organizations is that a particular silo has significantly more influence than another, often laying with the revenue generating lines of business.&nbsp; This over balance of power can easily lead to undue influence on your master data implementation, making it just another project for division X, instead of an enterprise resource to be shared by all.</p> 
       <p>Data governance is one of the key factors to help keep this situation in check. Your data governance board will be comprised of representatives from all stake holders, giving equal representation to all.&nbsp; The cross organizational nature of data governance is also the reason that decisions can be a difficult and lengthy process as it requires consensus across all the silos.</p> 
       <p>Aside from enterprise data definitions, another important aspect of master data management is the establishment of business rules.</p> 
       <h2>Too Many Rules</h2> 
       <p>The business and data governance will need to be involved to establish business rules for:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>ETL processes to loading data into your MDM application</li> 
        <li>Updates to information from multiple sources</li> 
        <li>Matching rules</li> 
        <li>Survivorship rules</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>The establishment of rules is designed to address one of the big problems MDM is meant to solve: data quality. Organizations will want to manage both data quality on load and ongoing data quality.&nbsp; One of the big mistakes often made is to try and introduce too many rules right away.</p> 
       <p>The use of too many rules early on can have a significant impact on the initial data loads into your MDM solution. You are ready for production and most likely getting your first crack at live data to only find out vast numbers of records are being rejected due to your business rules.&nbsp; Your data loads have now failed and you need to go back and rethink your rules, revise your ETL process and try again.</p> 
       <p>You finally get your data loaded and your consumers have arrived to start to use the data and your legacy transactions are failing. Why are they failing? Because the application isn’t validating the input according to your business rules, or collecting enough information to satisfy the rules.</p> 
       <p>Of course there is one way you could reduce this risk, but it often isn’t done well enough and sometimes isn’t done at all.</p> 
       <h2>What Profiling?</h2> 
       <p>Data profiling is the one task that is critical to understanding what your data looks like and what you need to plan for. There are often many barriers to profiling because your party master data will likely contain personally identifiable information (PII) and access will be restricted for security reasons.&nbsp; You have to overcome these barriers because data profiling is the only way to foresee the gotchas that are going to put you far off track down the road.</p> 
       <p>Data profiling can be a significant task as each source system needs to be profiled. As you learn more about your data you will have more questions that need to get answered.&nbsp; All this profiling takes time and most likely needs the time of specific resources as they are the only ones that have access to the information you require.&nbsp; (There’s that resource problem again.)</p> 
       <h2>Project Management is my Problem?</h2> 
       <p>So far you haven’t heard any magical reasons as to why your MDM implementation should fail. In fact&nbsp; many of the problems seem to be tied to the typical reasons any IT project can fail:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Underestimating the work</li> 
        <li>Not enough resources</li> 
        <li>Trying to do too much at once (including scope creep)</li> 
        <li>Time required for discovery</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>An aspect of an MDM implementation that may be a little non typical includes the need for data governance. Data governance not only gives you the enterprise view of the information you are trying to master, but can also be an effective way of dealing with competing agendas between silos.</p> 
       <p>Data governance is also one of the key success actors for the ongoing success of your implementation. Since MDM is a journey not a project, longevity is a characteristic of a successful implementation.&nbsp; Once you have delivered your foundation, the succeeding phases will build upon the base and provide more coverage of your master data.&nbsp; To ensure the ongoing success of your implementation you will need the support of data governance, to ensure that new systems and upgrades to existing systems use the master data and don’t just create islands of their own.</p> 
       <p>In the past we tried to achieve what master data management promises today, but with a lack of controls and governance, we ended up with the data sprawl we are trying to correct with MDM. Once the project is over, the role of master data management does not end.&nbsp; It is important to recognize that you must establish the processes and rules to not only create the master data store, but also to maintain it and integrate it into your systems.&nbsp; Master data management is not about the installation and configuration of a shiny new software product.&nbsp; The product is an enabler making the job easier.&nbsp; The establishment of rules, governance processes and enforcement are what will bring you success.</p> 
       <p>One final thing that every master data management implementation requires, and you are pretty much doomed to failure without, is strong executive sponsorship. Your MDM implementation is going to take years.&nbsp; You will require consistent funding and support to be able to take the journey and only an executive can bring that level of support.&nbsp; Organizations that are organized into silos often don’t play well together, and while data governance can help in this situation, the time may come when a little intervention is required to ensure things keep moving in the proper direction on the expected timelines.</p> 
       <p>Your executive is a key resource in and out of the board room.&nbsp; In the board room you will need t champion that has the vision of what your MDM implementation is going to bring to the organization, and keep the journey progressing over time.&nbsp; Out of the board room you will be faced with competing agendas, data hoarding, shifting priorities, and silos trying to work together.&nbsp; The executive influence here can be used to make sure that everyone continues to work towards the common goal, and provides the resources required to achieve the gaols in a reasonable time line.</p>

       </div> 
       <p><strong>This article was featured in the Q3 2014 edition of <em>Loyalty 360</em>‘s <em>Loyalty Management</em> magazine.<br> </strong></p> 
       <p>Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) companies have accepted for many decades that the reality of the industry is that the customers are interacting with intermediaries like digital merchants and retail outlets, not directly with them. The store gets to develop the relationship with the customer and the CPG company has to bridge a bigger gap, targeting end-users with broad strokes like TV commercials or billboards.</p> 
       <p>It’s hard to develop a sophisticated targeted marketing campaign or a customized loyalty offering, after all, when all of the customer data is being generated by the customer-store relationship, not the customer-product relationship. Stores typically have little incentive to offer detailed information about sales and other interactions to CPG brands – they naturally prefer consumers to be loyal to the store rather than loyal to the product brand names sold within, especially if the store offers their own branded products.</p> 
       <p><a href="https://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/photo_9438_20090131.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-579 aligncenter" src="http://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/photo_9438_20090131.jpg?w=300&amp;h=203" alt="old coke sign" width="300" height="203"></a></p> 
       <p>Ultimately, it can be tricky to make a connection when there’s a middle-man between you and your customer.</p> 
       <p>Not being able to easily connect has presented a number of challenges for the CPG industry in particular.</p> 
       <p>One of the overarching challenges is related to product development and promotion: a limited understanding of the customer can lead to imperfect offers and imperfect promotions.</p> 
       <p>That limited understanding is typically achieved through market research. CPG companies had to find alternative ways to gain insights about their target markets. Focus groups, surveys and coupon campaigns are costly and are all in some way imperfect (they provide limited data; they are based on small sample sizes; they are often not very timely etc.).</p> 
       <p>Big Data has the potential to change all of this. By analyzing millions and millions of social media comments, CPG companies are able to identify who purchases and uses their products. They can also determine the profiles of those consumers: what are their hobbies, what are their favourite TV shows, what initiatives resonate with them and are important to them?</p> 
       <p>It’s been said that social media networks are the ultimate focus group. It’s instant, uncensored customer feedback at a massive scale – and the ability to harvest this data and crunch it for analysis is providing CPG companies with a level of insight that was unimaginable just a few decades ago.</p> 
       <p>Not only is the customer feedback finally directly accessible, social media and other digital communications provide channels through which the CPG companies can speak directly to individual customers, bypassing the store entirely. This allows them to nurture relationships with end-consumers well beyond “hoping they see the billboard for the new cereal on their commute to work”. This opens the door to actual relationship-building tactics that companies in other industries have been using for years but have traditionally been unworkable for CPG.</p> 
       <p>Which leads me to the main question I want to pose:</p> 
       <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
       <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
       <p><strong>Can investments in Big Data capabilities make direct customer loyalty or CRM programs achievable for CPG companies?</strong></p> 
       <p>Historically, the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry didn’t see much potential in traditional loyalty or CRM programs; because the retailers selling their products were the ones interacting with the end consumer, it was hard to reach out to, establish, and then nurture relationships with individual buyers.</p> 
       <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
       <p><em>“Traditionally, CPG brands have few options when it comes to impacting purchase behavior in third-party retail environments, other than relying on costly in-store displays to grab shoppers’ attention. They also miss out on direct access to purchase data, which makes it difficult to know which marketing levers they can pull to get more of their brands into the shopping basket at checkout.” </em><strong>(Punchtab)</strong></p> 
       <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
       <p>Both CPG executives and expert industry observers have expressed skepticism in the past that a traditional loyalty program is a good fit for CPG.</p> 
       <p><em>“Consider the average loyalty program pays out under 2% for every dollar you purchase,” Jason Dubroy, VP managing director, Shopper DDB says. “Someone buying a $5 box of cereal [will get] less than $0.10 [from the] loyalty program. People may eventually realize the effort for them to enter 50 pins isn’t worth the value of the program.” </em><strong>(Strategy Online)</strong></p> 
       <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
       <p>It’s true that attempts at CPG loyalty programs in the past have proved too high-friction for consumers to really engage much with them. That isn’t the case anymore. As social media moves from being just another advertising platform to a being potential source of data and two-way customer communication, giving CPG brands the direct access to consumers that was once unattainable, industry leaders are considering the possibilities for a shift in their attitude towards loyalty.</p> 
       <p><em>“</em><em>There is an unprecedented opportunity for CPG companies to begin building deeper and more profitable relationships directly with consumers. Whereas loyalty programs were traditionally used by companies who owned the point-of-sale, today CPG marketers are able to leverage loyalty and analytics software to recognize &amp; reward loyalty in an entirely new way.”</em> <strong>(Crowdtwist, 2)</strong></p> 
       <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
       <p>Again, social media and other sources of big data about the customer offer the opportunity to <strong>avoid relying on the retailer</strong>, which has long been regarded as one of the biggest road blocks to CPG customer analytics at the level of the individual.</p> 
       <p><em>The move into the loyalty space would offer up CPG [companies] more transactional data to deal with (cutting out the middle-man retailer, Dubroy adds). “Retailers traditionally can give CPG companies about as much info as a bouncer [does] about who is at the party,” Sarna says. “Loyalty is much more like being the socialite who can wander around, who knows everyone and what they’re thinking.” </em><strong>(Strategy Online)</strong></p> 
       <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
       <p>The ability to finally <strong>isolate the individual</strong> and <strong>cater to them</strong> is an exciting and relatively new opportunity for the CPG industry.</p> 
       <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
       <p><em>“By being able to aggregate and attribute engagement, social activity and spend back to individuals, loyalty programs offer CPG marketers the ability to finally identify which of their efforts are most effective at stimulating consumer behavior and converting people along their path-to-purchase.”</em> <strong>(Crowdtwist, 6)</strong></p> 
       <p>CPG companies have already started experimenting with social and mobile targeted personalization of advertising and communications.</p> 
       <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
       <p><em>“One of the challenges with mobile is that it is such a personal device and impersonal messaging, whether is push message, an ad, or an offer, it doesn’t matter what it is or who it is coming from it is not well received,” John Caron, vice president of marketing for Catalina Marketing. “We know to how to leverage historical purchases, data and analytics to be able to identify and drive the right campaign in order to allow that to define the media that you see in app or mobile web on your smartphone,” he said. </em><strong>(Mobile Marketer)</strong></p> 
       <p>Indeed, the key word here is “personalization” for many of the emerging use cases that combine Big Data, loyalty and the CPG industry. How are they crafting the profiles and personas that they use to customize messages and offers for customers? The answer to this lies in linking internal and transactional data with external and social data; once a company has the power to match each real-life consumer to their online identity, they unlock a wealth of data that allows them to treat those individuals with a high degree of personalization.</p> 
       <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
       <p><em>“By combining consumers’ digital and social profiles and&nbsp;behaviors with real purchase data, CPGs have the ability to understand&nbsp;which online behaviors increase awareness, trial, preference and overall&nbsp;buy rates, while optimizing marketing effectiveness by focusing on the&nbsp;channels that matter most.” </em><strong>(Punchtab)</strong></p> 
       <p>What does “personalization” mean in terms of <strong>tangible steps</strong> a business can take? Bazaarvoice proposes:</p> 
       <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
       <p><em>“A brand can pre-sort reviews on product pages based on information gathered on the visitor. For example, a college student may see reviews first from other consumers identified as students. As you learn more about a shopper via purchase history, mobile app usage, online feedback, and the interest graph, tailor experiences to that individual. Use dynamic display and mobile ads to serve products the shopper is likely to enjoy alongside opinions from people with similar needs and tastes.” </em><strong>(Bazaarvoice, 4)</strong></p> 
       <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
       <p>Using customer data for the purposes of <strong>microsegmented marketing messages</strong> is a well-documented use case, but only recently has the data needed for this level of sophistication been accessible to the CPG industry. It’s a strategy that has been proving its ROI for a few years already.</p> 
       <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
       <p><em>“In a recent study involving more than 300 CPG brands and 80 companies, </em><em>Nielsen </em><em>reported that “CPG brands can experience a return of almost </em><em>$3 </em><em>in incremental sales for every dollar spent on online advertising that has been precisely delivered using purchase-based information”. When you consider the potential impact that better sources of data can have for an industry that spends </em><em>more than 25% </em><em>of the global advertising budget, the implications are astounding.” </em><strong>(Crowdtwist, 4)</strong></p> 
       <p>Beyond just more targeted advertising, the introduction of a loyalty or CRM program that works on the same principle of personalized offers and intelligent audience engagement has the potential to drive increased revenue beyond any one promotion or product.</p> 
       <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
       <p><em>“CPG companies can develop umbrella loyalty programs across their entire family of brands, rewarding consumers when they buy and engage with any of the brands in the portfolio. These programs can be highly effective in increasing trial, driving preference, and boosting cross-category purchase: a recent PunchTab survey showed that 73 percent of moms would be interested loyalty programs for a parent company, and 59 percent of moms would buy other products from the parent company if doing so resulted in more loyalty points — with 46 percent indicating they would even switch from a competitor’s product.”</em> <strong>(Punchtab)</strong></p> 
       <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
       <p>So what’s the potential payoff for pioneering CPG companies that launch loyalty programs using all this new customer data?</p> 
       <p><em>“Approximately </em><em>50% </em><em>of people who enroll in a CPG loyalty program remain actively engaged with that brand on a monthly basis, and they interact with the brand </em><em>2.5x more </em><em>often than the brand’s average consumer.</em> <em>Members who enroll in a CPG brand’s loyalty program are more likely to open branded emails, and are more likely to clickthrough on emails that contain a call-to-action. On average, our CPG client partners have experienced an increase of </em><em>109% </em><em>in email open rates and a </em><em>25% increase </em><em>in click-throughs for their program members.” </em><strong>(Crowdtwist, 3)</strong></p> 
       <p>The opportunity is clear; Big Data technology, enabling companies to gather social data and accurately match it to transactional data, may be the missing piece that makes investing in a loyalty program feasible and advantageous for companies operating in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry.</p> 
       <p>I argue that loyalty for CPG companies has never been intuitive or a perfect fit in the past, but it is now. In some respects, the CPG industry has the advantage of starting late – as they have no legacy systems to deal with, they have a clean slate. Companies investing in loyalty now will be doing it with 20+ years of established best practices in one pocket and the incredible technology available today in the other.</p> 
       <p>Perhaps even more importantly, companies can come at this with fresh eyes and a willingness to think above and beyond how things “have always been done”, because so few CPG companies have ever done much in the loyalty or CRM space before. Creativity, cleverness, and the ability to make full use of the tools and information available is a potent combination.</p> 
       <p>CPG companies are in an interesting position to potentially go from rarely bothering with loyalty to completely revolutionizing what can be accomplished with a loyalty or CRM program in a very short span of time.</p> 
       <p>Whether or not they <em>will</em> is another question entirely.</p>

       </div> 
       <p>Let me start by saying that this is not an article about big data.&nbsp; While the source of big data is external to your organization, it is a topic of its own.&nbsp; Many of the concepts and approaches discussed will definitely apply to your big data initiatives, but that won’t be the focus of this article.</p> 
       <p>External data is information that is sourced from outside of your organization.&nbsp; This could be information you purchase from a marketing or service organization, a government agency, the post office, or a business partner.&nbsp; There are many potential sources of external information.</p> 
       <p>External data can be used for various purposes in your MDM implementation.&nbsp; You can use external data to:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Enrich your MDM data with new information you are unable to collect on your own</li> 
        <li>Validate information you have captured in your own systems</li> 
        <li>Update information you have captured to improve the quality of the data</li> 
        <li>Use it as reference data to provide additional information without fully integrating it into your MDM system</li> 
        <li>Use it as a source of test data for environments where data privacy prevents usage without masking but valid data is required</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>There are many approaches that can be used to integrate external data with your MDM implementation.&nbsp; Your external data can be used to update your MDM data as is the case with enrichment and data quality initiatives.&nbsp; Your external data can be stored outside of your MDM implementation which is used for reference implementations and data quality initiatives.&nbsp; How you decide to integrate your external data can also have licensing implications either for your data provider or your MDM licensing.&nbsp; Integration choices, depending on the source, may also offer real time integration services versus taking the information base in-house.</p> 
       <p>When integrating information from external sources, you may face the issue of which source to trust over another.&nbsp; Typically, purchased sources from outside provide a high quality of information, while data provided by a business partner may have issues of its own.&nbsp; If you haven’t yet addressed trusted sources for your MDM single version of truth, external data sources may highlight this need.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><strong><strong>Using External Data for Enrichment</strong></strong></p> 
       <p>Data enrichment is the process of augmenting your MDM data with external information.&nbsp; Sources used for data enrichment are usually purchased and the provider has made significant investment ensuring the quality of that information.</p> 
       <p>When purchasing external data to be used for enrichment it is important to access the information provider, the data they provide, and even their information delivery methods.&nbsp; Things to consider could include:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Does the provider use appropriate methods to collect and validate the information?&nbsp; Data to be used for enrichment should be of high quality and be able to be trusted.</li> 
        <li>Is the information provided complete and consistent?&nbsp; You do not want to have to scrub external data you have paid for.</li> 
        <li>Is the information well formatted so it can be easily integrated with your own information?&nbsp; Addresses can be particularly troublesome to integrate if the core information is incomplete such as missing a country code, or inconsistently formatted, making parsing and standardization a challenge.</li> 
        <li>Does the licensing of the data allow you to keep the data you have stored in your MDM platform if you decide to discontinue licensing the data from the provider?&nbsp; Understand your rights using the information even after you decide you no longer want to purchase it.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>When integrating external data, make sure you understand the attributes you are collecting and that they are fit for the purpose intended.&nbsp; Status attributes and categorizations are usually tied to some business rules.&nbsp; Ensure that you and your consumers understand what the attributes mean and what they should be used for.</p> 
       <p>When purchasing external data, there’s often a rich set of attributes available for you to use in your MDM platform.&nbsp; Care should be taken to observe your MDM rules for what is and is not master data.&nbsp; Just because the attributes are available does not mean that you should automatically collect them. &nbsp;Select your external data attributes with the same rigor you apply to your internal data.&nbsp; Don’t collect the attributes because you can!</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><strong><strong>Using External Data for Validation and Quality Improvement</strong></strong></p> 
       <p>External data sources can be used to validate information you have collected from other sources.&nbsp; The most common of these validation processes is address validation.&nbsp; Address validation contributes to data quality and can often also provide correction capability so that addresses that were supplied incorrectly can be fixed to represent valid addresses.</p> 
       <p>Address correction can be a tricky proposition and may have implications for your consumers.&nbsp; If the address being captured in MDM is tied to a legal document such as a sale or insurance policy, correction may be unwanted as it changes the legal document – which cannot be arbitrarily changed.&nbsp; Address correction is also very susceptible to error if the address information was incomplete and missing key attributes such as country codes or postal/zip codes.&nbsp; The quality of the source data and the validation data can be an issue during this process.</p> 
       <p>Using external data for validation and quality improvement can have performance implications.&nbsp; The data source for the validation is usually outside of your MDM platform and so a call must be made to invoke the service.&nbsp; This adds time to your update time for validation.</p> 
       <p>Some providers may offer real time services which can be integrated with your MDM service to perform the validation and correction.&nbsp; The performance implications of calling an external service may also affect whether you use an in-house or external service.&nbsp; You may also want to consider applying the data validation and quality improvements after capturing the source data to keep MDM transaction performance high, and deal with the corrections afterwards.</p> 
       <p>External data sources can be a valuable tool to keep your MDM data clean and fresh.&nbsp; Validation routines can vastly improve the quality of your data by ensuring organizations exist on government registries and post office change of address files keep addresses current.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><strong><strong>External Data as Reference Data</strong></strong></p> 
       <p>External data does not always have to be integrated to be useful for an MDM implementation.&nbsp; You can decide to use the external data as reference data.&nbsp; When implementing external data as reference data your MDM platform contains an identifier, or key, from your external data on your MDM object.&nbsp; The identifier is used to identify the link between your MDM object (such as a party) to the additional information stored outside of MDM.&nbsp; This is the same concept you would use when tracking the source system key to your party record.</p> 
       <p>If the reference data approach is used then the implication is that queries for party data that incorporate attributes from the external data must be merged.&nbsp; The usual place for such integration of the two sources is the service bus.&nbsp; If you do not use such an integration platform, then it may be possible to extend your MDM platform to do the lookup in the external data source for you.&nbsp; If possible you may want to have a way to indicate when these additional attributes are actually required so you can avoid the additional overhead when the data is not required.&nbsp; You may use a separate service to get the two sets of information, or some kind of indicator to show that the two sources need to be queried.</p> 
       <p>Often when external data is integrated into MDM as reference data, there is a desire to provide services targeted only at the reference data, as it may have significantly more attributes available than is required in your MDM platform.&nbsp; Design these services so that your MDM platform requirements are also met by the same set of services to avoid duplicating effort.&nbsp; Both DB2 and Oracle provide tools to automate the generation of web services based on queries to databases and provide a simple capability to expose your reference data as a service.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><strong><strong>Using External Data as Test Data</strong></strong></p> 
       <p>Every implementation of MDM requires test data for testing of database performance, application features, and integration processes.&nbsp; Some environments have very strict rules on the use of data and often for MDM, valid data is required for testing, as standardization and validation routines depend on real data to perform properly.&nbsp; External data sources may be a useful tool for generating test data, because:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>It provides the volume of information required for performance testing and sizing estimates</li> 
        <li>It may be publically available information so there are no security issues with it being seen by staff and consultants</li> 
        <li>It is well formatted so it is easy to transform into the formats required for loading your MDM platform</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>You should check your licensing of the data before using it for long term testing purposes as you want to be able to retain test data even if you decide to stop your subscription for the external data.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><strong><strong>Trusted Sources</strong></strong></p> 
       <p>One of the new issues you may face when introducing external data is the concept of trusted sources.&nbsp; Trusted sources are data sources that are trusted to have higher quality data than other data sources that supply information.&nbsp; Since the external data is of higher quality you may not want values set from the external data to be replaced by values from an internal system.</p> 
       <p>A source trust framework may be required to prevent updates to information that was set by a more trusted source by a less trusted source.&nbsp; These update rules can be complicated and are often implemented with sophisticated tools such as rules engines.&nbsp; Source trust is often implemented in the integration platform, as it can be an enterprise problem.&nbsp; Source trust can also be implemented in your MDM platform for a localized solution.</p> 
       <p>An alternate approach that can also be used to control this type of data protection is to store the data from the trusted source in attributes dedicated to data from that source.&nbsp; A set of custom services with additional capability are used to process these attributes to keep them away from the normal consumers.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><strong><strong>Integrating External Data</strong></strong></p> 
       <p>There are many choices you will face when trying to integrate your external data.</p> 
       <p>Sometimes licensing can be one of the drivers affecting your decisions.&nbsp; Your MDM platform may be licensed according to the number of parties to be stored in the system.&nbsp; Your external data source may provide data for every organization in the country but you don’t do business with every organization, so loading them all into your MDM platform will just inflate the number of parties and thus needlessly affect your licensing.</p> 
       <p>Some data providers only supply complete extracts of the data and others provide a full extract and delta changes.&nbsp; When you are planning your use of the external data you may need to add your own change detection process requiring you to match the previous file with the current file to detect updates, adds and deletes.</p> 
       <p>Some data providers offer file based data as well as online, real time services for you to integrate with.&nbsp; You must consider:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>The amount of information you require versus the base of data that would need to be managed</li> 
        <li>The performance and cost implications of calling outside for the service versus an in-house service call</li> 
        <li>The cost of the file base of data compared to the cost of the size of data you really need and can be accessed real time</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>When using external data to enrich your MDM data, you need to be able to update your MDM platform based on changes reflected in the external data.&nbsp; Depending on the size of both your own MDM data and the external data, sophisticated processes may be required to apply the updates to your MDM platform.&nbsp; If large amounts of data need to be applied daily, then you may need to maintain pointers to your MDM data in the external data so you can efficiently process and avoid needless MDM lookups to see if anything is impacted.&nbsp; In this scenario you may want to consider having the external data be a consumer of MDM change notifications to keep its pointers up-to-date so you can recognize when a change in the external data affects your MDM data.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><strong><strong>In Summary</strong></strong></p> 
       <p>While we have talked mostly about purchased external data, data sourced from a business partner is subject to the same problems and considerations discussed here.&nbsp; External data can be a very useful tool especially when it comes to validation and enrichment.&nbsp; Be forewarned that there is work involved to integrate the external data, but the rewards associated with higher quality and breadth and depth can be of significant business value.</p>

       <div class="post-info"> 
        <p> <span class="time">June 4, 2014</span> <span class="author">by <a href="http://blog.infotrellis.com/author/infotrellislauren/" title="Posts by Lauren Craig" rel="author">Lauren Craig</a></span> <span class="post-comments"><a href="http://blog.infotrellis.com/2014/06/04/one-citys-small-business-loyalty-programs-are-becoming-an-interconnected-web/#comments" title="Comment on One City’s Small Business Loyalty Programs Are Becoming An Interconnected&nbsp;Web">1 Comment</a></span> </p>

       <p>Wouldn’t it be cool to pay for parking with points accumulated at your favorite local coffee shop? What about getting a new pair of shoes with points earned by frequently picking up bread at the local bakery? Or going out for a round of golf courtesy of the dry cleaners you visit all the time?</p> 
       <p>Small businesses can’t compete with big chains or corporations when it comes to loyalty programs. They don’t have the capital to invest in building massive, innovative programs, and often have to depend on something simple like a small stamp card, which doesn’t provide them with any customer data or differentiate between higher or lower value customers.</p> 
       <p>Impressive loyalty analytics, customized rewards, and easily tracked points are often the mark of a large company – these sorts of features usually aren’t accessible to small businesses with less data and fewer resources.</p> 
       <p>A company in the Netherlands called Shopper Concepts is looking to change that.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><a href="https://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-572" src="http://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image5.png?w=300&amp;h=238" alt="Image5" width="300" height="238"></a></p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>In partnership with InfoTrellis, Shopper Concepts is creating a loyalty management and analytics program for the connected, savvy customer. This loyalty platform, called Buzzoek, is emerging as a unique and powerful tool for small business owners. Throughout Amsterdam, local businesses that use this loyalty platform pool their resources, sharing transactional data for more powerful analytics, connecting to better learn the individuals who buy from them and what their likes are. They can even enable customers to use rewards points earned at one store in any other store that uses the same program.</p> 
       <p>Consumers can even share their rewards with friends (or even total strangers!) via Facebook, Twitter or Email. The team behind the Buzzoek loyalty program has also partnered with UNICEF to allow program members to donate their rewards directly to charity.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><a href="https://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-570" src="http://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image1.png?w=300&amp;h=208" alt="Image1" width="300" height="208"></a></p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>They even combine their rewards programs into one convenient tap card across all of the involved businesses – Buzzoek converts a card the customer already has in their wallet (like a transit pass or a library card) into a rewards card that can be used at any one of the fifty locations using their program.</p> 
       <p>With an established foothold in the city of Amsterdam, the company is building a networked web of small local businesses that have the loyalty data and analytics capabilities of a massive corporation.</p> 
       <p>This isn’t the first example of people using communal resource pooling to sidestep the involvement of corporations. With consumers coming together to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/hello?ref=footer">crowdfund projects and products</a> they want to see, local communities <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/08/mesh-internet-privacy-nsa-isp">launching their own internet</a> using rooftop wifi antennas, and even groups of programmers creating goofy cryptocurrencies that they then used to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/dogecoin-jamaican-bobsled-team-olympics-2014-1">send teams of athletes to the Olympics</a>, people are increasingly coming together to accomplish previously unachievable things in unison with other invested individuals.</p> 
       <p>Shoppers Concepts is already in full force with its dozens of connected stores, bringing together businesses like Alexander Hairstylers, Chocolate Company, and Doppio Espresso to reach exciting goals with their loyalty programs they would have struggled to accomplish in isolation. Using the InfoTrellis AllSight Big Data Insights Engine, Shoppers Concepts is making bold new steps towards simplifying things for consumers and enabling small businesses to work together to serve them better.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><a href="https://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-571" src="http://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image4.png?w=199&amp;h=300" alt="Image4" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

       <p>Suddenly, small businesses can interact with and reward their customers like the big businesses do. Considering the fact that small businesses are typically more flexible and connected with their community than larger ones, could this signal the beginning of a new era of small entrepreneurs fueled by next gen loyalty technology?</p>

       <div class="post-info"> 
        <p> <span class="time">May 2, 2014</span> <span class="author">by <a href="http://blog.infotrellis.com/author/infotrellislauren/" title="Posts by Lauren Craig" rel="author">Lauren Craig</a></span> <span class="post-comments"><a href="http://blog.infotrellis.com/2014/05/02/hotel-industry-walletshare-reclamation-with-customer-connectid/#comments" title="Comment on Hotel Industry Walletshare Reclamation with Customer&nbsp;ConnectId">1 Comment</a></span> </p> 
       </div> 
       <p>When you’re in the hotel industry, even the absolute most loyal of loyalty members will stray to the competition from time to time. Figuring out how to identify and combat this tendency is increasingly falling to technology, which has made dramatic leaps and bounds in data discovery when it comes to increasing loyalty member walletshare.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>One technology that is driving progress for hotels in this arena is the Big Data powered “Customer ConnectId™”, a solution built by InfoTrellis to gather and match online social profiles to loyalty member profiles.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><a href="http://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ccidmatchdeatil-view_high.jpg"><img id="i-559" class="size-full wp-image aligncenter" src="http://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ccidmatchdeatil-view_high.jpg?w=650" alt="Image"></a></p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>Like any new technology, the proof is in the pudding – and that pudding is the first customer use case. With this particular identity resolution technology, the first use case is taking place within the prestigious offices of one of North America’s leading hotel chains.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>In the hands of the hotel’s analytics team, the ability to connect loyalty member profiles up with their public online activity (like Twitter accounts, Facebook accounts and travel website reviews) became a powerful tool in their search for better strategies for increasing customer loyalty and, ultimately, loyalty member walletshare.</p> 
       <p>Initial work with the massive new sources of data, automatically matched and consolidated into customer records, provided fascinating information about how people indicate travel when they interact with social media. The hotel’s analytics team discovered:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Comparing customer check-in rates to those same customers’ FourSquare and Yelp check-ins with competing hotels, they were ahead of their competition</li> 
        <li>BUT, comparing customer check-in rates to those customers’ FourSquare and Yelp check-ins with their own hotels, they only broadcasted about 50% of actual check-ins, suggesting that:</li> 
        <li>The average socially active hotel guest only checks in to FourSquare or Yelp about half of the time</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
       <p><a href="http://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ccidhotelchart2.png"><img id="i-565" class="size-full wp-image aligncenter" src="http://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ccidhotelchart2.png?w=650" alt="Image"></a></p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>This meant that while at first glance they seemed to be retaining their loyalty members with a high degree of success, more rigorous scrutiny revealed that they were likely staying with the competition as much as 50 – 60% of the time when they travelled.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>To provide a higher rate of accuracy when it came to pinpointing when their loyalty members were staying with the competition, the analytics team expanded their search to include check-ins at airports and restaurants far from the person’s hometown – both good indicators of travel. They also started leveraging the technology’s Natural Language Processing capability to incorporate informal, unstructured “check-in” messages, like a casual mention or reference to travel in a tweet or an update.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><a href="http://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ccidhotelchart1.png"><img id="i-562" class="size-full wp-image aligncenter" src="http://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ccidhotelchart1.png?w=509" alt="Image"></a></p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>The end result of all this hard work is that now they have a much clearer idea of which of their loyalty members are staying with the competition and how often and, eventually, will be able to build models that help them to understand why they chose to stay with the completion. The immediate benefit is that their loyalty and marketing teams now have an unambiguous target list of loyalty members who travel frequently without staying with them – an obvious opportunity for the most growth with the least effort, if they can target them with the right offers and messages to win back a greater share of their business.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>The next steps for their test of the technology will be to build out the depth of the profiles by pulling extra dimensions from the social data that can be used to understand their motives, behaviors, and preferences.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>By employing a machine learning algorithm they expect to be able to get as much information as they can about their 10+ million loyalty members and then, using this complex pattern identification technology, accurately predict things like hobbies, interests, life events, job title and family status for those loyalty members who don’t list them explicitly. From there, ten million loyalty members suddenly become much easier to understand and custom-tailor offerings and experiences for.</p>

       <div class="post-info"> 
        <p> <span class="time">April 22, 2014</span> <span class="author">by <a href="http://blog.infotrellis.com/author/skandaitls/" title="Posts by Skanda" rel="author">Skanda</a></span> <span class="post-comments"><a href="http://blog.infotrellis.com/2014/04/22/managing-mdm-projects-preparation/#comments" title="Comment on Managing MDM Projects –&nbsp;Preparation">2 Comments</a></span> </p> 
       </div> 
       <p>Every project comes with its own set of challenges and MDM projects are no different. At InfoTrellis, we have built an effective methodology for Project Management, through years of experience in managing MDM projects. We like to call it as “<strong>InfoTrellis Smart MDM Methodology</strong>”.</p> 
       <p>The InfoTrellis Smart MDM Methodology is:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>A common sense based approach</li> 
        <li>Constructed uniquely to meet challenges in MDM Projects</li> 
        <li>Applies principles of RUP, Waterfall, and Agile project management models</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>It is an iterative delivery methodology that is designed to link business value and strategy into tactical, quick, and logically sequenced deliverables.</p> 
       <p><a href="http://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/smart-mdm-methodology.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-543" src="http://infotrellis.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/smart-mdm-methodology.png?w=742&amp;h=263" alt="Smart MDM methodology" width="742" height="263"></a></p> 
       <p>As you can see in the figure above, there are five stages to this methodology. They are:</p> 
       <ol> 
        <li>Discovery and Assessment</li> 
        <li>Scope and Approach</li> 
        <li>Analysis and Design</li> 
        <li>Development and QA</li> 
        <li>Deployment</li> 
       </ol> 
       <p>I am going to group them into three master groups and discuss about each of these groups and challenges arising within them.</p> 
       <h2></h2> 
       <h2>The Preparation</h2> 
       <p>As the heading suggests, this section talks about the initial preparations the team has to do before starting an MDM implementation. The stages “Discovery &amp; Assessment and Scope &amp; Approach” are part of the preparatory steps one has to take.</p> 
       <h3>Discovery &amp; Assessment</h3> 
       <p>Our “Discovery” of the client’s MDM needs does not always start at the same point. These are the possible starting points:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Client only has a business issue and is looking for a solution within the available tools in the organization</li> 
        <li>Client has a business issue, realizes that the issue cannot be resolved with the available tools in the organization and willing to explore further</li> 
        <li>Client has a business problem, knows that MDM is a solution but not sure about&nbsp;the next steps</li> 
        <li>Client has a road map, high level MDM architecture in place, and wants a validation of architecture and further collaboration during implementation</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>We take different approaches to each of these scenarios. Our objective in each case would be to help the client identify the right solution. As part of this phase, we come up with:</p> 
       <h4>A clear business case:</h4> 
       <ul> 
        <li>The true nature of the issue is not always clear at the beginning due to various environmental factors in an organization. Through constant inquiries, we identify all the issues faced, categorize them, prioritize them, and see if MDM is the right solution. At the end of our inquiries, if the discovery is that the client does not need an MDM solution, it is our duty to inform this to the client as well.</li> 
        <li>Once the client decides on implementing an MDM solution, we continue our discovery by understanding the client’s business goals, current systems in place, and overall data vision of the organization.</li> 
        <li>A strong business case for MDM is built with this understanding, and we help the primary sponsors of the project in selling the MDM vision to rest of the sponsors and stakeholders.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <h4>Program Roadmap:</h4> 
       <ul> 
        <li>As part of the roadmap, we identify key master data entities (Customer, Product, Supplier, Account and so on), identify the different sources to be integrated, decide on features of MDM to be implemented, and prioritize each one of them</li> 
        <li>A comprehensive data quality assessment is also done in order to plan for quality fixes well in time for requirements. In the next section below&nbsp;titled “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Source Data Quality</span>”, I have elaborated on the ways to do data quality analysis</li> 
        <li>A phased approach to a multi-year roadmap is taken targeting key business deliveries at the end of each phase</li> 
        <li>For a long term MDM investment, it is important to build the entire vision and roadmap at the beginning. This would help us anticipate and plan upcoming changes in the client’s technology and business landscape and phase our implementation accordingly</li> 
        <li>Once the roadmap is in place, the implementation should be in baby steps such that the sponsors start seeing tangible benefits of the implementation as early as possible through small victories that cumulatively meets the MDM vision over the years</li> 
       </ul> 
       <h4><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Source Data Quality</span>:</h4> 
       <p>Poor Data Quality causes significant delay in MDM implementation plans. We get hit during the requirements / data mapping phase and also during the actual deployment. So, it is very important that a thorough Data Quality analysis using optimal tools is done even before we sit for requirements elicitation.</p> 
       <p>If possible, it would be best to analyze and identify data quality issues across all the sources that will be integrated before the actual implementation starts. If this is not possible due to various reasons, we should at least identify the first set of sources that will be integrated, and identify and fix quality issues within them. This will solve two things:</p> 
       <ol> 
        <li>We will be ready for the first phase and when we sit for data mapping, there will be sufficient clarity and minimal rework</li> 
        <li>Once we get a grip on quality of data, along with what will be accepted by MDM, a parallel team can start working on analyzing the remaining source systems, ready in time for subsequent phases</li> 
       </ol> 
       <p>There are also cases when we are brought in to make an assessment of an existing MDM implementation. For such clients, we don’t have to build their MDM roadmap or vision from the beginning, but based on what we see as the state of their MDM implementation, we help them re-align their vision and build a program roadmap from that point. Our rigorous approach in coming up with the re-aligned vision and roadmap is the same as the one we employ for a new implementation.</p> 
       <h4>Scope &amp; Approach</h4> 
       <p>As part of discovery, I mentioned having a long term vision. It is not only important to have a clear roadmap; having a strong, structured implementation plan is even more important.</p> 
       <p>The approach to an MDM implementation should cover the following:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Determine priority of each of the master entities in the organization, and decide on which entity to implement first</li> 
        <li>Identify source systems, analyze them, and come up with an integration plan of source systems</li> 
        <li>As applicable, plan for building all necessary support architecture to handle real-time, near real-time and batch load data. For clients that already have these in place, evaluate and ensure readiness for MDM implementation</li> 
        <li>In alignment with the client business and IT teams, come up with tangible deliverables for each phase that business can use, or see value in</li> 
        <li>Come up with high level requirements document that forms the basis of detailed functional requirements and data mapping that should be created in subsequent phases</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>With the above details, a detailed Project Scope document that spills out all the phases of the project, and deliverables across each phase&nbsp;is&nbsp;created. A high level project plan that tracks timelines and milestones&nbsp;is also&nbsp;created along with the scope document.</p> 
       <h3>The Non-’iterative’ preparation:</h3> 
       <p>So far, we have seen the initial preparatory tasks to be done before starting the next stages of MDM implementation. Through our experience, we have learned that the preparatory tasks are&nbsp;best done in a sequential or “waterfall” way, with sufficient time and expertise loaded at the top.</p> 
       <p>Benefits of an MDM implementation are realized over many years, and a wrong step during the preparatory phase would lead to unrealized vision, and heavy losses towards the end. So, we provide sufficient time for Discovery, Assessment, Scoping and Approach. Once the preparations are in place, we can start following an iterative / agile based management for a much faster implementation.</p> 
       <p>In Part II of this series, I will cover rest of the stages in our Methodology when I talk about “Implementation” and “Deployment”.</p>

       <div class="post-info"> 
        <p> <span class="time">March 28, 2014</span> <span class="author">by <a href="http://blog.infotrellis.com/author/ochughtai/" title="Posts by ochughtai" rel="author">ochughtai</a></span> <span class="post-comments"><a href="http://blog.infotrellis.com/2014/03/28/what-is-a-product/#comments" title="Comment on What is a&nbsp;Product?">1 Comment</a></span> </p> 
       </div> 
       <p>Product Information Management (PIM) is a vast subject area. Not only does each industry vertical have its own way of defining a product, within a particular vertical each company may choose to represent their product information differently to satisfy their particular business needs. Having said that, there are indeed standard practices and processes that makes PIM expertise portable across various projects.</p> 
       <p>The first step to understanding PIM is to get an appreciation of the diversity around the definition of product. The example below, from the retail industry, provides some insight in to the complex world of PIM. In my subsequent blogs, I will address various nuances of product modeling.</p> 
       <p><strong>What is a Product?</strong><br>We all love shopping. But have you ever wondered what it takes for your favorite product to reach a store shelf, or what that product means for the retailer? This blog is going to take you through the journey of a diaper bag from supplier to store shelf – let’s see if we can figure out what a product is.</p> 
       <p>So let’s start backwards.</p> 
       <p>You see the diaper bag on the store shelf – how did it get there? Well, each store has an inventory area at its back and you must have seen store workers periodically replenishing the shelves with products. That’s one way the shelves are filled. The other way is that vendors themselves come over and stock the shelves. This is referred to as direct store delivery, or DSD; one example might be 2-liter Coca Cola bottles. DSD is, however, a discussion for another day. By the way, the product that you see on the store shelf is also referred to as the sellable unit.</p> 
       <p>So how does that diaper get to the store’s inventory area? Each store has an inventory management and an ordering system; any time the inventory falls beyond a certain limit, an order is placed with the relevant distribution center for supply replenishment. The ordering lead times are already known, so the ordering takes place in such a way that the store seldom runs out of diapers. Ordering may be manual or automated based off of the inventory levels.</p> 
       <p>So how does the diaper get to the distribution center/warehouse? This is a complex piece and is also referred to as “Network Alignment”, where the supply chain managers determine which suppliers are going to supply which distribution centers, and which distribution centers, in turn, are going to service which stores. The network alignment is product specific and is usually based off of geographical locations. The distribution centers have to keep track of their inventory levels as well as their lead times both from the supplier ordering (inbound) and store ordering (outbound) perspective to maintain the service level agreements (SLAs) with the stores. Also, distribution centers have their own stocking unit for each product, which they use to manage inventory.</p> 
       <p>It takes months of planning before the product actually hits the store shelves. A lot of systems (e.g. Item Master, Planogram, Labelling and Shelf Tags, Warehouse Management, ERP, Forecasting, Pricing and Promotions, Data Warehouse and Analytics, etc.) have to be set up with item information as part of the new item introduction (NPI) process.</p> 
       <p>So then, what is a product? Well simply put, product means different things to different stakeholders -for a warehouse management system product is the stocking unit; for a store product is the sellable unit, for analytics product is diapers irrespective of whether it is being sold as a bag or travel pack. It depends on your perspective.</p>

       <p>There are lots of excellent lists out there for who to follow on the subjects of customer experience, Big Data, and social media technology – but what about Master Data Management? Finding a bit of a dearth of resources for MDM Twitter influencers, I decided to put together a little list of my own on the people I personally find are great for MDM content in the Twittersphere.</p>

His Tweets often serve the purpose of circulating great content, and it’s a fairly event split between articles and research produced by other MDM experts and ones put out by his company, Grandite. He’s consistent with crediting the sources, too, so he makes it easy to expand your follow list.</p>

       <p>Although as part of the marketing team for Informatica, Shankar links a predictably large amount of content produced by the company, it’s usually interesting content and worth reading. If you’re looking for MDM and data governance stuff on Twitter, he’s got it in spades, and many of them are resources that can be easily absorbed by more business-focused folk than pure IT folks.</p>
