While they are an IT services firm, they train their consultants in the business function of the products that they implement.\n\nAkili is a professional services organization and in many ways their people are their product. They understand that their ability to consistently deliver world class solutions to their clients is wholly dependent on their ability to attract and retain world class team members.
