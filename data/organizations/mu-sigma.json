      "description": "Mu Sigma, one of the world\u2019s largest Decision Sciences and analytics firms, helps companies institutionalize data-driven decision making and harness Big Data\nAnalytics and data-driven decision making have been well recognized as a distinctive competitive advantage in a world of Big Data and increasing business complexity. However, organizations are challenged with scaling the use of analytics and making it an integral part of all business decisions. Mu Sigma addresses this critical need and enables organizations to institutionalize analytics and Decision Sciences in a sustainable manner.\n\nWe work with market leading organizations across multiple industry verticals solving high impact business problems in key horizontals such as Marketing, Risk and Supply Chain. We provide our clients with a holistic ecosystem of proprietary technology platforms, processes and people, which scales the use of our unique interdisciplinary approach to Decision Sciences. We believe that leveraging data effectively to enable Decision Support requires a combination of Data Engineering, Data Sciences and Decision Sciences. Data Engineering is the application of technology for collecting, storing, processing, transforming and structuring of data. Data Sciences refers to the application of math and technology to solve focused business problems with well-defined scopes. However, the dynamic nature of business requires Decision Sciences, an interdisciplinary approach of business, applied math, technology, design thinking and behavioural sciences, to solve constantly shifting and ill-defined business problems.\n\nWe help organizations traverse the journey from Data Engineering to Data Sciences and Decision Sciences thereby institutionalizing Decision Support.\n\nWe establish ongoing relationships with our clients in a white box and collaborative manner to create a better art for problem solving. Our integrated DIPP\u2122 approach and close engagement with our clients empower them to not only scale the creation of analytics, but also facilitate the translation and consumption of insights to maximize ROI from analytics initiatives.\n\nOur expertise and experience cut across multiple and disparate verticals such as CPG &amp; Retail, BFSI, Pharma, Healthcare, Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT) and many more. We believe that in a world of blurring value-chain boundaries and continuous transformation, organizations can profit from cross industry / domain expertise. Over the years, we have leveraged this experience to enable innovation and convergence for our clients.\n\nWith over 2500 Decision Sciences professionals, and over 75 Fortune 500 clients across 10 industry verticals, we are one of the largest Decision Sciences and analytics companies. Our interdisciplinary approach to problem solving using cross-industry expertise corroborate our sustainable engagement model with our clients, making us one of the most preferred analytics and Decision Sciences partners among our contemporaries.\n",
