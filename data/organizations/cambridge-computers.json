      "description": "Cambridge Computer is a small company (about 75 people) making a big impact in the data storage industry. Founded in 1991 as a specialty integrator of backup systems and archival storage solutions, Cambridge was responsible for authoring many of the industry-wide best practices for enterprise backup system optimization. We took a similar role during the storage networking revolution of the late 1990s by authoring the best practices for the deployment of next generation storage networking solutions.\n\nWe derive revenue from three major sources:\n\nTraining -- We run world-class training services focused on data protection and storage management technologies. We have provided education for more than 5000 IT professionals over the last decade. You will find our people lecturing at major universites around the country, at the leading conferences, at client sites, and in our training facilities located in Waltham, Massachusetts.\n\nSolution Architecture -- This is a unique service that helps clients pick the best storage strategy for their organizations. This service requires no upfront fees, commitments, or premiums to pay. Imagine if world class consulting were FREE. Wouldn&#39;t you take advantage of it?\n\nProfessional Services -- We have a team of backup and storage experts that offer needs analysis, performance optimization, installations, optimizations, and documentation. We compete head to head with the leading integrators, consulting firms, and manufacturers in this space.\n",
