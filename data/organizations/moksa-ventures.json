      "description": "Technological innovation in digital and social media, big data, mobility, cloud computing and their technological descendants drastically lowers the cost of entry for entrepreneurs to test and capitalize on their ideas.\n\nAs investors, we like that.\n\nWe want to work with tech-savvy entrepreneurs who use creativity and innovation to build great businesses. However, we look for more than just a technology advantage when investing, as technology alone doesn\u2019t guarantee a winning business. Don\u2019t get us wrong\u2014we like patents and technological advantage as much as the next venture capitalist. We just see that in many fields, technology itself is no longer the differentiator and source of strategic advantage it once was\u2014odds are you\u2019re one of several entrepreneurs chasing similar ideas with similar technologies.\n\nSo how will you win?\n\nWe put on our hardhats and dig deeper. We look for entrepreneurs who think like designers in every aspect of their business model and product. They leverage creativity to fulfill an unmet need through the development of elegant products, seamless user experience or addictive game mechanics.  They lead teams of expert developers and designers, analytics jocks and user experience mavens. We want the founder who leverages neuroscience research to build new communities via social media, and we cheer on the innovator who applies behavioral psychology to consumer engagement or employee motivation. In an era of massive media forces pulling us in every direction, we are working to build out a new layer of engagement based on skills pioneered and mastered by the digital game industry: the game layer. As game mechanics become more deeply integrated into the technology we rely on every day, we will see this engaging digital game layer take center stage in businesses, homes and communities for the next decade.\n",
